<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in"><B>WHEREAS</B>, highly
competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors or officers or in other capacities
unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims
and actions against them arising out of their service to, and activities on behalf of, the corporation; this is because such persons
in service to corporations are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other
things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the corporation or business enterprise itself; and</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in"><B>WHEREAS,</B> the
Board of Directors of the Company (the &quot;Board&quot;) has determined that, to attract and retain qualified individuals, the
Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company
and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities; and</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in"><B>WHEREAS,</B> the
Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests
of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of
such protection in the future; and</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in"><B>WHEREAS,</B> it
is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to obligate itself contractually to indemnify, and to advance expenses on
behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company
free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; and</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in"><B>WHEREAS,</B> this

shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and</P>

of Sections 78.7502 and 78.751 of the Nevada General Corporation Law (&ldquo;NGCL&rdquo;) is nonexclusive, and therefore contemplates
that contracts may be entered into with respect to indemnification of directors, officers and employees; and</P>

is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that
he be so indemnified;</P>

this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and
information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification,

shall direct Independent Counsel to make such determination in a written opinion to the Board of the Company, a copy of which shall
be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested
Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board of the Company, or (B) by a committee of the Disinterested Directors designated

shall be delivered to Indemnitee; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee
shall be made within 10 days after such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred
by Indemnitee in cooperating with the person, persons or entity making the determination discussed in this Section 8(b) with respect
to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's
entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.</P>

shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so
selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection
shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided,
however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements
of &ldquo;Independent Counsel&rdquo; as defined in this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual
basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such
written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless
and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after
submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall
have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a Texas Court (as defined herein) for resolution
