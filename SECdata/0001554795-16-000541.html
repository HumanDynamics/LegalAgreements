<P STYLE="font: 10pt/normal Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On January 19, 2016, the Company completed
the closing of a private placement financing transaction (the &ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;) with Cerebrus, pursuant to a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Cerebrus Purchase Agreement&rdquo;). Pursuant to the Cerebrus Purchase Agreement, Cerebrus purchased
an 8% Convertible Debenture (the &ldquo;Cerebrus Debenture&rdquo;) in the aggregate principal amount of $34,775, and delivered
on January 25, 2016, gross proceeds of $25,000 excluding transaction costs, fees, and expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt/normal Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Principal and interest is due and payable
January 19, 2017, and the Cerebrus Debenture is convertible into shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at any time at the
discretion of Cerebrus at a VCP. The VCP is calculated as the lowest trading price during the eighteen (18) trading days immediately
prior to the conversion date multiplied by fifty eight percent (58%), representing a forty two percent (42%) discount.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt/normal Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company may prepay the Cerebrus
Debenture, subject to prior notice to Cerebrus within an initial 30 day period after issuance, by paying an amount equal to 118%
multiplied by the amount that the Company is prepaying. For each additional 30 day period the amount being prepaid is multiplied
by an additional 6%, up to a maximum of 148% on the 180<SUP>th</SUP> day from issuance. Beginning on the 180<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;day
after the issuance of the Cerebrus Debenture, the Company is not permitted to prepay the Cerebrus Debenture, so long as the Cerebrus
Debenture is still outstanding, unless the Company and Cerebrus agree otherwise in writing.</P>

a leader in Compassionate Care Technology and agricultural solutions for the recreational cannabis industry, today announced the
Company has eliminated and re-negotiated the removal of approximately $850,000 in toxic debt from two lenders on the Company's
balance sheet. The negotiation also included new commitments to fund approximately $250,000 in new working capital, of which $87,500
has been funded, with new institutional lenders seeking a long term relationship with Agritek Holdings. The new lenders also purchased
approximately $350,000 in aged notes from Tonaquint, Inc. and Vis Vires Group, Inc.</FONT></P>

has assured us their cooperation and belief in Agritek Holdings and new funding in place, I feel extremely confident that we can
