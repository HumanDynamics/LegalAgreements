Shares which represent less than 80% of the Fund&#146;s outstanding Preferred Shares; (2)&nbsp;the Financing Condition (as defined in the Offer to Purchase accompanying the Tender Offer) has not been satisfied or waived; (3)&nbsp;such transactions,
if consummated, would (a)&nbsp;result in delisting of the Fund&#146;s common shares from the New York Stock Exchange; (b)&nbsp;impair the Fund&#146;s status as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which would make
the Fund subject to federal income tax on all of its net income and gains in addition to the taxation of shareholders who receive distributions from the Fund); or (c)&nbsp;result in a liquidation of the Fund or a mandatory redemption due to the

connection with the Tender Offer; or (d)&nbsp;otherwise directly or indirectly materially adversely affects the Tender Offer or the Fund; (5)&nbsp;there is any (a)&nbsp;suspension of or limitation on prices for trading securities generally on the
New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange(s); (b)&nbsp;declaration of a banking moratorium by Federal or state authorities or any suspension of payment by banks in the United States or New York State; or (c)&nbsp;limitation

&#147;Fund Parties&#148;) and Morgan Stanley&nbsp;&amp; Co. LLC (&#147;Morgan Stanley&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WHEREAS, Morgan Stanley is a substantial holder of auction
rate preferred shares issued by the Fund (the &#147;ARPS&#148;), a closed-end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 for which JPMIM currently serves as investment adviser; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WHEREAS, Morgan Stanley has engaged in discussions with the Fund Parties regarding a proposal that the Fund conduct an issuer tender offer for the ARPS, and
in that connection entered into a confidentiality agreement dated September&nbsp;29, 2015 (the &#147;Confidentiality Agreement&#148;), regarding confidentiality obligations with respect to the discussions (together, the &#147;Discussions&#148;);
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WHEREAS, the parties wish to resolve various matters associated with the Discussions and Morgan Stanley&#146;s holdings of the ARPS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. Tender Offer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to satisfaction of Section&nbsp;2 below, the Fund Parties agree to commence, not later than March&nbsp;11, 2016, a tender offer by the Fund for 100%
of its issued and outstanding ARPS at a price equal to 95.5% of the $25,000 per share liquidation preference of the ARPS (<I>i.e.</I>, a tender offer of $23,875 per ARPS share), scheduled to expire as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on
the 20<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> business day following commencement (such date, as it may be extended in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer, the &#147;Expiration Date&#148;), subject to substantially the same
conditions as are set forth in Appendix A hereto (the &#147;Tender Offer&#148;). The Fund hereby agrees that if, as of the Expiration Date of the Tender Offer, all of such conditions are satisfied or in its sole discretion, waived, it shall accept
for payment all ARPS properly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. Agreements and Obligations of Morgan Stanley. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Morgan Stanley hereby agrees and undertakes that: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Tender
Offer is conducted by the Fund, Morgan Stanley shall tender one-hundred percent (100%)&nbsp;of the ARPS of the Fund held by it for its own account (i.e., 486 ARPS as of the date the Agreement), such that Morgan Stanley would have no holdings of the
ARPS for its own account following acceptance by the Fund Parties of the Tender Offer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. Confidentiality. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Morgan Stanley and the Fund Parties hereby agree to and do hereby extend the term of the Confidentiality Agreement and their respective obligations
thereunder, until the first to occur of (i)&nbsp;the commencement of the Tender Offer; (ii)&nbsp;the public disclosure of this Agreement or (iii)&nbsp;two years from the date hereof, in the event the Tender Offer is not commenced <U>provided</U>
that the Fund Parties may disclose the subject matter of the Tender Offer to third parties, including to other holders of the ARPS and to service providers and agents who may be engaged to assist in conducting the Tender Offer, before the Tender
Offer is publicly announced. For the avoidance of doubt, Morgan Stanley acknowledges that the Fund will be required to file a copy of this Agreement with its Form TO filings in connection with the Tender Offer. </P>

Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;March 11, 2016, if the Fund has not on or before that date commenced the Tender Offer and (ii)&nbsp;the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the business day next following the Expiration Date,
if the Funds have not accepted validly tendered ARPS for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer by such time. In the case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(i) and Section&nbsp;4(ii), all provisions of this Agreement shall
terminate and have no further force or effect upon such termination, except that the confidentiality obligations of the parties under Section&nbsp;3 hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement for the
period set forth in Section&nbsp;3 hereof. In the case of the completion of the Tender Offer the obligations of the parties under Sections 3, 4 and 6 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. Financing Efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Fund hereby agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into the credit facility necessary to satisfy the Financing Condition, which is a material condition to the Tender Offer (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;) as soon as practicable following the date hereof. The
Credit Facility shall provide the Fund with financing sufficient for the payment in full of all consideration payable in the event that all of the holders of the ARPS tender their ARPS and the payment of all costs and fees to be borne by the Fund in
connection with the Tender Offer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">6. Miscellaneous. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a)

that the Fund will not accept tenders or effect repurchases, unless otherwise determined by the Fund&#146;s Board, if: (1)&nbsp;there have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer that number of Preferred
Shares which represent less than 80% of the Fund&#146;s outstanding Preferred Shares; (2)&nbsp;the Financing Condition (as defined in the Offer to Purchase accompanying the Tender Offer) has not been satisfied or waived; (3)&nbsp;such transactions,
if consummated, would (a)&nbsp;result in delisting of the Fund&#146;s common shares from the New York Stock Exchange; (b)&nbsp;impair the Fund&#146;s status as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which would make
the Fund subject to federal income tax on all of its net income and gains in addition to the taxation of shareholders who receive distributions from the Fund); or (c)&nbsp;result in a liquidation of the Fund or a mandatory redemption due to the
failure of the Fund to comply with the applicable maintenance amount or asset coverage requirements in the event any senior securities are issued and outstanding; (4)&nbsp;there shall be instituted or pending before any governmental entity or court
any action, proceeding, application or claim, or any judgment, order or injunction sought, or any other action taken by any person or entity, which (a)&nbsp;restrains, prohibits or materially delays the making or consummation of the Tender Offer;
(b)&nbsp;challenges the acquisition by the Fund of the ARPS pursuant to the Tender Offer or the Board&#146;s fulfillment of its fiduciary obligations in connection with the Tender Offer; (c)&nbsp;seeks to obtain any material amount of damages in
connection with the Tender Offer; or (d)&nbsp;otherwise directly or indirectly materially adversely affects the Tender Offer or the Fund; (5)&nbsp;there is any (a)&nbsp;suspension of or limitation on prices for trading securities generally on the
New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange(s); (b)&nbsp;declaration of a banking moratorium by Federal or state authorities or any suspension of payment by banks in the United States or New York State; or (c)&nbsp;limitation
affecting the Fund or the issuers of its portfolio securities imposed by federal or state authorities on the extension of credit by lending institutions; or (6)&nbsp;the Board determines that effecting any such transaction would constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duty owed to the Fund or holders of its Preferred Shares. </P>

Stock, Series W </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NEW YORK, NEW YORK, February&nbsp;12, 2016 &#150; Pacholder High Yield Fund, Inc. (NYSE: PHF) (the &#147;Fund&#148;) announced today
that its Board of Directors has authorized a cash tender offer to purchase up to 100% of its outstanding shares of the Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series W (the &#147;Preferred Shares&#148;) from holders of the Preferred Shares (the
&#147;Preferred Shareholders&#148;) at a price equal to 95.5% of the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (or $23,875 per share), plus any unpaid accrued dividends. The Fund intends to finance the tender offer using borrowings under a credit
facility that the Fund expects to enter into in the near term, subject to completion of the negotiation of a definitive agreement (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;). Among other conditions, the tender offer is subject to the Fund&#146;s entry into
the Credit Facility and the availability of sufficient funds thereunder to finance the purchase of the Preferred Shares in the tender offer (the &#147;Financing Condition&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Further Information Regarding the Proposed Tender Offer </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the Financing Condition, the tender offer is conditioned upon at least 80% of the outstanding Preferred Shares being validly tendered and not
withdrawn (the &#147;Minimum Condition&#148;). Two substantial Preferred Shareholders, RiverNorth Capital Management, LLC and its affiliates and Morgan Stanley&nbsp;&amp; Co. LLC, have provided commitments to the Fund that they will participate in
the tender offer. These commitments, if honored, will satisfy the Minimum Condition. In connection with these commitments, the Fund has agreed to commence the tender offer no later than March&nbsp;11, 2016, and the tender offer will remain open for
at least twenty business days following the date of the commencement of the offer. All tendering instructions and a complete explanation of the tender offer&#146;s terms and conditions will be described in the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter
of Transmittal, and other materials relating to the tender offer that will be distributed to the Preferred Shareholders upon commencement of the tender offer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the Fund&#146;s Board of Directors has authorized the Fund to commence the tender offer, neither the Fund, nor the Board of Directors, nor J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc., the investment advisor of the Fund, has made any recommendation to any Preferred Shareholder whether to tender or refrain from tendering any Preferred Shares. The Preferred Shareholders are urged to consult their own
investment and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender any Preferred Shares and, if so, how many Preferred Shares to tender. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Important Information </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The anticipated tender offer
described in this press release has not yet commenced. The discussion of the tender offer contained in this press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to purchase, nor the solicitation of an offer to sell, any of the
Fund&#146;s Preferred Shares. While the Fund intends to commence the tender offer within a reasonable time following the date of this press release and complete the tender offer, there can be no assurances that the Fund will commence or complete the
tender offer on the terms described in this press release, or at all.</B> If the Fund commences the tender offer, the offer to purchase and solicitation of the Preferred Shares will be made only pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, the related Letter
of Transmittal, and other related materials, as they may be amended or supplemented. Such documents will be distributed to the Preferred Shareholders upon commencement of the tender offer. Preferred Shareholders should read those materials carefully
when they become available before making any decisions with respect to the tender offer because they will contain important information. The Fund will also file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule </P>
