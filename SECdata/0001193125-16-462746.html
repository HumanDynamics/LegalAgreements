<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) In order to continue to promote the alignment of executive compensation and long-term shareholder value creation, the Compensation
Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of MSCI Inc. (&#147;MSCI&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted certain changes to its executive compensation program for the ten senior managers who comprise the Company&#146;s
Executive Committee. The Committee believes that MSCI&#146;s executive compensation program should reinforce a performance culture that is in close alignment with the interests of its shareholders by incorporating the achievement of both financial
metrics and share-based performance targets into annual incentive compensation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As previously reported, and consistent with this
philosophy, on July 27, 2015, the Committee adopted a cash bonus plan that represented a shift to a more formulaic cash variable compensation approach that is intended to measure one-year performance results against financial targets and certain
strategic goals (the &#147;Cash Bonus Plan&#148;). In connection with year-end compensation determinations, on February&nbsp;8, 2016, the Committee adopted a new approach to its long-term equity incentive compensation program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has historically granted performance stock units (&#147;PSUs&#148;) that vested based on the achievement of certain financial
performance measures (e.g., revenue growth, EPS and ROIC). Commencing with the Company&#146;s grant of equity compensation in 2016, the Company&#146;s approach to long-term equity incentive compensation has shifted from multi-year financial
performance-based awards to multi-year total shareholder return (&#147;TSR&#148;) based awards, which the Committee believes more closely aligns the Executive Committee&#146;s interests with those of the Company&#146;s shareholders. Under this new
long-term equity incentive compensation program, Mr.&nbsp;Henry&nbsp;A. Fernandez (Chief Executive Officer) will receive 100% of his equity compensation grant in the form of PSUs, the operational members of the Company&#146;s Executive Committee,
including Mr. C.D. Baer Pettit (Chief Operating Officer), will each receive his or her equity compensation grant 80% in the form of PSUs and 20% in the form of time-based vesting restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) and the staff members of the
Company&#146;s Executive Committee will each receive his or her equity compensation grant 60% in the form of PSUs and 40% in the form of time-based vesting RSUs. In prior years, all Executive Committee members received their equity compensation
grants 50% in the form of PSUs and 50% in the form of RSUs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;8, 2016, the Committee approved the grant of multi-year PSUs
(the &#147;Multi-Year PSUs&#148;) under this new long-term equity incentive compensation program to the members of the Company&#146;s Executive Committee, including Messrs. Fernandez and Pettit. The Multi-Year PSUs are intended to cover three years
of the PSU component of equity compensation, and, as such, the Executive Committee members will not receive grants of PSUs in 2017 or 2018. The Committee believes that the grant of the Multi-Year PSUs to the Executive Committee members will provide
greater incentives for the execution of the Company&#146;s three-year strategic plan and the creation of additional value enhancing corporate development initiatives. Those Executive Committee members who receive RSUs as a component of their equity
compensation will continue to be granted RSUs annually. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Multi-Year PSUs will cliff-vest on February&nbsp;8, 2019, subject generally
to the executive&#146;s continued employment with the Company and the Company&#146;s level of achievement of the applicable absolute TSR compounded annual growth rate (&#147;TSR CAGR&#148;) and relative TSR CAGR (&#147;Relative TSR CAGR&#148;)
performance metrics measured over a minimum three-year performance period. Achievement of the Relative TSR CAGR performance metric is determined based on the percentile ranking of the Company&#146;s TSR CAGR relative to other companies that were
constituents of the MSCI USA MIDCAP Index as of February&nbsp;9, 2016 (the &#147;Midcap Index&#148;). The initial three-year performance period may be extended for an additional period of six months only in the event that both the TSR CAGR and
Relative TSR CAGR performance metrics achieved by the Company are below the specified threshold performance levels. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February 8, 2016, the Committee approved the grant of Multi-Year PSUs to Messrs. Fernandez and
Pettit with target values of $17.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively. Since the Multi-Year PSUs are intended to cover three years of the PSU component of equity compensation and Mr. Fernandez received 100% of his equity compensation award in
the form of PSUs, he will not receive grants of RSUs or PSUs in 2017 or 2018. Mr. Pettit will not receive grants of PSUs in 2017 or 2018. In determining the target value of the Multi-Year PSUs, the Committee took into consideration executive officer
performance and potential future contributions, peer group analyses and the increased risk profile of the compensation program in relation to the executive officer, including the relatively high percentage of the PSU component of his or her
long-term equity incentive compensation. The target number of shares of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share (each, a &#147;Share&#148;), underlying such awards will be determined by reference to the fair value of a PSU as of the grant
date of the Multi-Year PSUs. Each Multi-Year PSU reflects the right to receive between 0% and 300% of the target number of Shares based on achievement of the TSR CAGR and Relative TSR CAGR performance metrics. More than 50% of the value of
Mr.&nbsp;Fernandez&#146;s Multi-Year PSU award is contingent, subject to shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan (as defined below). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
table below sets forth the TSR CAGR adjustment percentage. There will be extrapolation and interpolation (rounded to two decimal places) to derive a TSR CAGR adjustment percentage that is not expressly set forth in the table below, and any resulting
fractional shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

a portion of their awards will be subject to the approval by the Company&#146;s shareholders of the MSCI Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#147;Omnibus Plan&#148;)&#151;a new equity incentive compensation plan that the Company will propose for
approval at the Company&#146;s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. In the event the Company&#146;s shareholders do not approve the Omnibus Plan, the portion of the awards subject to approval of the Omnibus Plan will be cancelled. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On termination of the executive&#146;s employment due to his death or &#147;disability&#148; (as such term is defined in the applicable form
of Multi-Year PSU award agreement), a pro-rated portion of the PSUs will service-vest based on the number of months elapsed from the date of grant until the date of termination, plus 12 months (up to a maximum of 36 months). On an involuntary
termination of the executive&#146;s employment by the Company without &#147;cause&#148; (as such term is defined in the applicable form of Multi-Year PSU award agreement), a pro-rated portion of the award will vest as follows: (i)&nbsp;one-third of
the award will service-vest if such termination of employment occurs prior to the one year anniversary of the grant date of the award, (ii)&nbsp;two-thirds of the award will service-vest if such termination of employment occurs after the first
anniversary but before the second anniversary of the grant date of the award and (iii)&nbsp;100% of the award will service-vest if such termination of employment occurs after the second anniversary of the grant date of the award. For recipients who
are eligible for &#147;full career retirement&#148; (as such term is defined in the applicable form of Multi-Year PSU award agreement), including Messrs. Fernandez and Pettit, in the event of such executive&#146;s retirement, one-third of the award
will service-vest. In each of the foregoing circumstances, the number of PSUs that will convert into Shares will be based on the Company&#146;s actual level of attainment of the applicable TSR performance metrics as of the end of the performance
period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon a &#147;qualifying termination&#148; of employment within 24 months after a &#147;change in control&#148; of the Company (as
such terms are defined in the applicable form of Multi-Year PSU award agreement), a pro-rated portion of the PSUs will service-vest based on the number of months elapsed from the grant date of the award until the date of termination, plus 12 months
(up to a maximum of 36 months), and the applicable performance metrics will be deemed to have been achieved at the greater of (i)&nbsp;the actual level of attainment of the applicable TSR performance metrics as of the date of the change in control
and (ii)&nbsp;100%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Multi-Year PSU awards contain post-employment restrictions against competition, the solicitation of clients and
employees of the Company and the use or disclosure of confidential information by a departing executive officer. In addition, the Multi-Year PSU awards granted to executive officers are also subject to the Company&#146;s Compensation Clawback
Policy, which provides that the Committee may recoup incentive-based compensation if it determines that certain financial results or operating metrics were achieved as a result of willful misconduct, intentional fraudulent or illegal conduct, or
with that executive officer&#146;s knowledge of such conduct by another person. Executive Committee members are subject to the Company&#146;s stock ownership guidelines. </P>

align your interests with those of the Company. As such, you will earn your Adjusted PSUs (as defined below) only if you remain in continuous employment with the Company through the Vesting Date, or as otherwise set forth below. Each PSU corresponds
to one share of MSCI common stock, par value $0.01 per share (each, a &#147;<B>Share</B>&#148;). Each PSU constitutes a contingent and unsecured promise by MSCI to deliver one Share on the conversion date for such PSU. </P>

Assuming you hold PSUs on the record date, MSCI will credit the dividend equivalent payments when it pays the corresponding dividend on its Shares. Your dividend equivalents will vest and be paid at the same time as, and subject to the same vesting
and cancellation provisions set forth in this Award Agreement with respect to, your PSUs (<I>provided</I> that, subject to Section 21, the dividend equivalents may be paid following the scheduled conversion date on the next regularly scheduled
payroll date). No dividend equivalents will be paid to you with respect to any canceled or forfeited PSUs. MSCI will decide on the form of payment and may pay dividend equivalents in Shares, in cash or in a combination thereof, unless otherwise

Service Termination, to the extent permitted under Section&nbsp;409A, your PSUs will be adjusted (within a range of [&#9679;]% to [&#9679;]%) based on the expected (or actual, as the case may be if such termination occurs after the expiration of the
Performance Period) achievement of the Performance Metrics for the Performance Period, which will be determined by extrapolating from the Performance Metrics that have been achieved as of the end of the most recent completed fiscal quarter prior to
the date your employment with the Company terminates, and such Adjusted PSUs will vest and convert into Shares within 60 days following the date of such termination. If your employment with the Company terminates after the Adjustment Date in a

making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
