<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On February 11, 2016 (the &ldquo;Closing
Date&rdquo;), we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with SBI Investments LLC,
2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability company (&ldquo;SBI&rdquo;). Under the Purchase Agreement, SBI agreed
to purchase from us our promissory note (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) in the principal amount of $330,000. SBI has the right to convert
the Note into shares of our Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, following the occurrence of an event of default under the
Note (an &ldquo;Event of Default&rdquo;), including the failure to repay the note on or before August 9, 2016 (the &ldquo;Maturity
Date&rdquo;). The Note bears interest at the rate of 0% per annum until the occurrence of an Event of Default, at which time the
Note bears default interest at the rate of 22% per annum.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On the Closing Date, we also issued and
sold to SBI, and SBI purchased from us, the Note for a purchase price of $300,000.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We will use the proceeds from the Note as
follows: approximately $110,000 will be used for the purchase of component equipment, plus associated crating and freight charges,
to be delivered to a customer under an existing sale contract; approximately $100,000 will be used to pay professional fees; and
approximately $90,000 will be used for other selling, general and administrative expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Following the occurrence of an Event
of Default, the holder of the Note has the right to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of
the Note into shares of our Common Stock at the Conversion Price. Except as otherwise provided in the Note, the conversion
price (the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo;) equals 60% of the average of the three lowest daily weighted volume average prices
for shares of our Common Stock during the 20 trading day period ending on the date on which the holder requests conversion of
the Note (the &ldquo;Conversion Date&rdquo;). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of the
Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below), by the Conversion Price on the date of
conversion. The Note provides that &ldquo;Conversion Amount&rdquo; means the sum of (1) the principal amount of the Note to
be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the option of the holder, default interest accrued at 22% per annum,  if any, on
the principal amount to be converted, (3) at the holder&rsquo;s option, any amounts owed pursuant to provisions of the Note
ensuring that adequate shares of our Common Stock are reserved and available for issuance upon conversion and (4) liquidated
damages accrued at the rate of $2000 per date if we fail to deliver conversion shares. The conversion rights of the holder of
the Note are limited to the extent that such conversion would result in beneficial ownership by the holder and its affiliates
of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment
if we declare or make any distribution of assets to our shareholders or make certain dilutive issuances of our equity securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As a condition to the obligation of SBI
to purchase the Note, we have entered into Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions with our transfer agent, Vstock Transfer, LLC
(the &ldquo;Transfer Agent&rdquo;) (the &ldquo;Instructions&rdquo;). The Instructions authorize and instruct the Transfer Agent
to establish an initial reserve of 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to cover the conversion of the Note and request the Transfer
Agent and to act immediately with respect to the issuance of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to any notices of conversion received
from SBI. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify the Transfer Agent under certain circumstances relating to the issuance of shares
of our Common Stock upon conversion of the Note.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Note provides that an Event of Default
will occur if we fail to pay the Note when due, fail to issue shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of the Note, breach
our covenants in the Note, the Purchase Agreement or other transaction documents, breach any of the representations and warranties
that we have made to SBI, become subject to a judgment in excess of $50,000, cease our operations, fail to maintain our of our
material intellectual property or other assets or restate our financial statements, among other occurrences. Additionally, an Event
of Default will occur if we sell all or substantially all of our assets, if we effect a transaction or series of transaction in
which more than 50% of the voting power of our shares is disposed of or if we merge, consolidate or effect a business combination
with any other person when we are not the surviving entity.</P>

payable upon delivery of equipment to a customer under an existing sales contract.</P>

The Holder shall have the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to the extent that any Event of Default (as defined
in <U>Article III</U>) has occurred and is continuing, at any time during the period beginning on the Issue Date and ending on
the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in <U>Article III</U>) pursuant

Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which
such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the &ldquo;<U>Conversion Price</U>&rdquo;)
determined as provided herein (a &ldquo;<U>Conversion</U>&rdquo;); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in no event shall the
Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum
of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock
which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;<U>Exchange
Act</U>&rdquo;), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso, <U>provided</U>,
<U>further</U>, <U>however</U>, that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder,
not less than 61 days&rsquo; prior notice to the Borrower, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply
until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The number
of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount
(as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the
form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> (the &ldquo;<U>Notice of Conversion</U>&rdquo;), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder
in accordance with <U>Section 1.4</U> below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by
other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time
on such conversion date (the &ldquo;<U>Conversion Date</U>&rdquo;). For purposes of this <U>Section 1.1</U>, in determining the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated
in the most recent of the following: (i) the Borrower&rsquo;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;<U>SEC</U>&rdquo;), as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Borrower,
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Borrower or the Borrower&rsquo;s transfer agent setting forth the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Borrower, shall within one business day confirm
orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. The term &ldquo;<U>Conversion Amount</U>&rdquo;
means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion
<U>plus</U> (2) at the Holder&rsquo;s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding
clause (1) <U>plus</U> (3) at the Holder&rsquo;s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to <U>Sections 1.3</U> and <U>1.4(g)</U>
hereof.</P>
