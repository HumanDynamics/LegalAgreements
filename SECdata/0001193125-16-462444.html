before the Merger, appointed five new directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors. Mr.&nbsp;Schecter and Mr.&nbsp;Gildea thereafter resigned effective the Closing Date. The appointment of Garo H. Armen, Khalil Barrage, Robert B. Stein,

shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (which is currently held by the former Protagenic stockholders, the investors in the Private Offering and the Designee) will immediately and automatically convert into 9,685,306 shares of our common stock

board determines to provide such special treatment to beneficial holders generally, the beneficial holders of our common stock beneficially holding 1,546,371 or fewer shares of our common stock but at least 100 shares of our common stock would
receive 100 shares of our common stock after the Reverse Split, and persons beneficially holding less than 100 shares of our common stock would not be affected by the Reverse Split and would continue to hold the same number of shares as such

Delaware corporation specializing in the discovery and development of therapeutics to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Our mission is to provide safe and effective treatments for mood, anxiety, depression and neurodegenerative disorders
by using novel peptide-base, brain active therapeutics. Our strategy is to develop, test and obtain regulatory approval for various applications of these brain active therapeutics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current business model is designed around the further development of these applications, and to obtain the required regulatory approvals
to allow for the commercialization of our neuropeptide-based applications and products (see &#147;Governmental Regulation&#148; below). If approval is obtained, we expect to begin our sales efforts and anticipate generating revenue through both
licensing and direct sales of our products. We believe that we can establish and subsequently strengthen our market position in the following ways: (i)&nbsp;working to obtain FDA approval of current and future neuropeptide applications;
(ii)&nbsp;investigating foreign markets for the use of our current and future products; (iii)&nbsp;securing relationships with strong partners in our field; (iv)&nbsp;entering into license agreements, strategic partnerships and joint ventures for
our various applications; and, (v)&nbsp;continuing our current research into improving our processes, reducing costs and developing new and innovative applications. </P>

Disorders </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An estimated 340&nbsp;million people worldwide and 40-60&nbsp;million people in the United States alone suffer from mental
disorders including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder and various Anxiety Disorders. The global sales of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs were US $69 billion in 2013 and are projected to grow to nearly $77.1 billion by 2018 (BCC
Research). Yet, <I>up to one-half</I> of mood disorder patients are <I>unresponsive</I> to current treatments and about <I>two thirds</I> experience <I>side effects</I>. Efficacy of therapy is challenged by non-compliance during the weeks to months
required to achieve therapeutic benefit in combination with daily dosing requirements. Major targets in this space include TRD and PTSD, both indications which are highly resistant to available therapies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>TRD</B> is the type of MDD that does not respond to standard courses of antidepressant medication. Stress plays a significant role in this
illness that affects as many as half of people diagnosed with depression. Patients suffering with TRD are at greater risk of hospitalization for their psychiatric illness and are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. These patients have a lower
long-term quality of life and are at increased risk of attempting suicide. As a last resort, this disease is currently managed by invasive treatment, primarily electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, the ECT treatment&#146;s side effects and high
cost prevent millions of people from taking advantage of it. </P>

disproportionately high prevalence in war veterans. Therapeutic approaches include cognitive therapy in combination with antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition to the vulnerabilities noted above for
antidepressant-related treatments, PTSD patients often present with co-morbidities such as addictions or dependencies, which make therapeutic case management difficult. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Protagenic Research </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PT00114 is the first
known example of a new class of brain-targeted therapies based on a newly-described and highly conserved family of neuropeptides that regulate stress-induced mood and addictive behaviors. PT00114 is believed to act via a novel mechanism of action
and is therefore expected to provide an extremely attractive therapeutic and commercial profile, especially for those patients who are not fully responsive to or compliant with current interventions. Based on preclinical data, we believe that
PT00114 is well differentiated from other drug candidates on the basis of having: Dual activity on stress- and addiction-related pathways (as present in TRD and PTSD); Blood-brain barrier permeability; Rapid onset of action and long duration of
therapeutic effects; Restoration of normalcy in stress, anxiety and addiction disorders; No adverse effects with little to no accumulation; Good safety and tolerability profiles; Convenient dosing route and schedule; High potency/low dose; and, Ease
of chemical synthesis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that optimal cellular energy metabolism is fundamental to the biology of the brain, and clinical
manifestation of aberrant energy metabolism often manifests in debilitating neurological disorders. PT00114&#146;s ability in preclinical models to enhance glucose mobilization and utilization in the brain, maintain energy homeostasis, inhibit
stress-related pathways and protect cells from oxidative damage suggests potential therapeutic benefits in a range of indications involving both acute and chronic neurological injury. Potential applications include traumatic brain injury, stroke
recovery, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#146;s disease, Parkinson&#146;s disease and ALS, among others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Technology </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TCAP-1 was discovered in a genome-wide search for proteins related to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a key brain peptide hormone in
stress response. While TCAP-1 counteracts stress, it does so by a non-CRF receptor pathway and unlike direct CRF antagonists it does not exhibit negative effects in animal models studied to date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PT00114 inhibits stress and stress (CRF)-induced actions in clinically-relevant gold-standard animal models of anxiety, depression and
addiction at concentrations several magnitudes below current front-line therapeutics. These beneficial effects are maintained for as long as three weeks after treatment. PT00114 promotes neuronal process development, spine density, axon
fasciculation and branching in neurons. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently do not own any manufacturing facilities, nor have we entered into any agreements with contract manufacturer for the production of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense research
and development efforts. We expect to compete with companies, including major international pharmaceutical companies, and other institutions that have substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales capabilities and
have substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and selling biopharmaceutical products. We will face competition based on, among other things, product
efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, product ease of use and price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In particular, the market for
antidepressant drugs is highly competitive as it is the largest growing segment of the central nervous system (CNS) pharmaceutical sector. In 2006 global sales of antidepressants peaked at US$22 billion capitalizing on the serendipitous discoveries
of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and older mononamine oxidase inhibitor technologies. However, 38% of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients that do not respond to the current
antidepressant medications constitute a separate group of treatment resistant depression (TRD). Despite a large patient population and current treatments that leave much room for improvement, the developmental pipelines are sparse and few novel
candidates are in development. The serendipitous discoveries of current drug classes, side effects and lack of efficacy have led to shrinkage or extinction of many pharma or small biotech neuroscience research programs. It is in this TRD market that
we intend to launch PT00114. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Set forth below is a discussion of competitive factors for each of the current drug classes commercially
available for TRD, and the competitive advantages that we believe PT00114 may offer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>Opioid receptor modulators </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Opioid receptor modulators have the potential to be non-addictive therapeutic drugs for TRD. Competitors include ALKS 5461 (from Alkermes) is a
fixed combination of buprenorphine and samidorphan being developed as a therapy for TRD. Buprenorphine is a mu opioid receptor partial agonist as well as an antagonist of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), while samidorphan is an antagonist of mu
opioid receptors that essentially works to block the buprenorphine from binding to the mu-receptor. The combination of these mechanisms may result in attenuation of the mu agonist effects of buprenorphine, potentially making this a non-addictive
therapy. ALKS 5461 is in phase 3 as a once-daily therapy administered as a sublingual tablet. It is well tolerated and treatment effects were evident after one week of dosing. We believe that our competitive advantage is that PT00114 targets
different receptor system therefore it is not likely to have a clinical overlap with opioid receptor modulators. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Brexpiprazole (from Otsuka) is a dopamine (D2 receptor) partial stimulator (agonist) approved as an oral adjunctive TRD therapy. Its side
effects include suicidal risk, weight gain and restlessness. Cariprazine (from Gedeon Richter) is an oral dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in development for TRD. The most common side effects
reported were extrapyramidal symptoms, the urge to move (akathisia), indigestion (dyspepsia), vomiting, drowsiness (somnolence) and restlessness. We believe that our competitive advantage is that PT00114, due to its low toxicity profile, will be
clinically preferable to these antipsychotic drugs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>Ketamine-like TRD drugs </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Drugs that act in a mechanism similar to Ketamine, such as Esketamine nasal spray (from Johnson and Johnson) is the S(+) enantiomer of the drug
ketamine acts primarily as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but is also a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. As of July 2014, it is in phase II clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This class of candidates is generating a
lot of excitement but uncertainty due to their use history will be a compounding factor. We believe that our competitive advantage is that the toxicity profile is likely to be less favorable when compared with PT00114. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>NMDA receptor modulators </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
N-methyl-D-aspartate (or &#147;NMDA&#148;) receptor is a molecule that appears on the surface of neurons. When &#147;activated&#148; by a drug that binds with it, the NMDA receptor is a potential natural way to counteract TRD. A drug called GLYX 13,
an amidated tetrapeptide (with the amino acid sequence Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr-NH2) is a glycine-site functional partial agonist of the NMDA receptor discovered at Northwestern University, now being developed by Naurex/Allergan, in Phase 3 U.S. clinical
trials. It will be administered by intravenous injection and has a rapid onset. Phase 2 results have shown that GLYX 13 treatment reduces depression scores in patients with TRD, with no psychotomimetic side effects common to other NMDA receptor
modulators. The major peptide candidate in this group GLYX13 shows a better tolerance profile and even IV dosing once weekly is not a deterrent enough in the clinic so PT00114 peptide with possible subcutaneous delivery would be a much more
preferable clinical option. The development of the tetrapeptide and entry into the trials demonstrated room and willingness to accept peptide based therapies in TRD. More candidates are expected to come from this therapeutic class that may present a
competitive challenge for PT00114. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another of Naurex&#146;s small molecule candidates, NRX-1074, is an orally active therapy based on
GLYX13, in preclinical stages. L-4-Chlorokynurenine, AV-101 (from VistaGen Therapeutics) is a fast acting, orally active small molecule glycine binding site NMDA receptor antagonist. A NIH-funded phase 2 trial in major depressive disorder has been
initiated in the US. CERC-301 (Cerecor) is an orally-active, selective NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) antagonist which is in phase 2 an adjunctive therapy for TRD. We believe PT00114 will be able to compete against each of these drugs based on its
core advantages. </P>

circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patent may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. In particular, we do not know if competitors will be able to design
variations on our treatment methods to circumvent our current and anticipated patent claims. Furthermore, competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required
for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized or marketed, any related patent claim may expire or remain in force for only a short period following
commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage of the patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also rely upon trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, proprietary
know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We continue to seek ways to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, including
entering into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants, and controlling access to and distribution of our technologies and other proprietary information. While we use these and other reasonable security measures to
protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of third
parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patents would require us to alter our products or technology, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our failure to obtain a license to technology that we may require to
discover, develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. One or more third-party patents or patent applications may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights. Any such conflict may
substantially reduce the coverage of any rights that may issue from the patent applications to which we have rights. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we
may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our technologies are subject to extensive government regulation, principally by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the
&#147;<B>FDA</B>&#148;) and state and local authorities in the United States and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. Governmental authorities in the United States extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy,
research, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical products under various federal laws including the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and under comparable laws by the states and in most foreign countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Domestic Regulation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the FDA, under the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject
pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products or product
candidates, and we may be criminally prosecuted. The FDA also has the authority to discontinue or suspend manufacture or distribution, require a product withdrawal or recall or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations, if we fail to comply
with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems following initial marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>FDA Approval Process </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data demonstrating the product&#146;s safety and
efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this entails extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. This testing and the preparation of necessary
applications and processing of those applications by the FDA are expensive and typically take many years to complete. The FDA may deny our applications or may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter
significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing any products we may develop. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved
products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems
following initial marketing. With respect to patented products or technologies, delays imposed by the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have the exclusive right to exploit the products or
technologies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process required by the FDA before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: </P>

results of preclinical testing, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND application before clinical
trials may begin, in order to ensure that human research subjects will not be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials, or may
authorize trials only on specified terms. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of our products. Moreover, positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical trials, together
with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product, in the form of an NDA, or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA has 180&nbsp;days to review
the application and respond to the applicant. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and
recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, but the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is possible that our product candidates will not successfully proceed through this approval process or that the FDA will not approve them
in any specific period of time, or at all. The FDA may deny or delay approval of applications that do not meet applicable regulatory criteria, or if the FDA determines that the clinical data do not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the
product. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements for a new biologic is a process that may take several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. The
FDA reviews these applications and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the product is both safe and effective and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing.
Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical
trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Upon approval, a product candidate may be marketed only for those

the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety, efficacy or other problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may, during its review of an NDA or BLA, ask for additional test data. If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, it may require
post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase IV studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the product. In addition, the FDA may, in some circumstances, impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult

compliance with the cGMP requirements. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control, record keeping and reporting to ensure full compliance with those requirements. Failure to comply with
these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, voluntary recall of product, withdrawal of marketing approval or civil or criminal penalties. Adverse
experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not
maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The labeling, advertising, promotion,
marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and FTC requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and
educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing
the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and enforcement actions that can include seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. </P>

issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and deny or withdraw approvals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>HIPAA Requirements </I></P>

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In relevant part, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to such health information. The first rule imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable
health information. These standards restrict the manner and circumstances under which covered entities may use and disclose protected health information so as to protect the privacy of that information. The second rule released by HHS establishes
minimum standards for the security of electronic health information. While we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA, the HIPAA standards impose requirements on covered entities conducting research activities
regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected in the course of conducting the research. As a result, unless they meet these HIPAA requirements, covered entities conducting clinical trials for us may not
be able to share with us any results from clinical trials that include such health information. </P>

compounds may not demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and they may interact with human biological systems or other drugs in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If we are

regulatory approval. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive and will take several years to complete and may not yield results that support further clinical development or product approvals. Conducting clinical studies for any of our
drug candidates for approval in the United States requires filing an IND and reaching agreement with the FDA on clinical protocols, finding appropriate clinical sites and clinical investigators, securing approvals for such studies from the
independent review board at each such site, manufacturing clinical quantities of drug candidates, supplying drug product to clinical sites and enrolling sufficient numbers of participants. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully

may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or we may not receive approvals to make claims about our products that we believe to be necessary to effectively market our products. Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are
subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and failure to comply with regulatory requirements or inadequate manufacturing processes are examples of other problems that could prevent approval. In
addition, we may encounter delays or rejections due to additional government regulation from future legislation, administrative action or changes in the FDA policy. Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval will be limited to those

products to determine whether they should be covered by reimbursement and if so, the level of reimbursement that will apply. We cannot be certain that third party payers will sufficiently reimburse sales of our products, or enable us to sell our
products at profitable prices. Similar concerns could also limit the reimbursement amounts that health insurers or government agencies in other countries are prepared to pay for our products. In many countries where we plan to market our products,

legal, scientific and factual questions. The standards which the United States Patent and Trademark Office uses to grant patents, and the standards which courts use to interpret patents, are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can
change, particularly as new technologies develop. Consequently, the level of protection, if any, that will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them, and they are challenged, is uncertain. In addition, the type and extent of patent

property rights. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technologies without authorization and they may resort to litigation to attempt to enforce their rights. Third parties may have or obtain patents in the future and
claim that the use of our technology or any of our product candidates infringes their patents. We may not be able to develop or commercialize combination product candidates because of patent protection others have. Our business will be harmed if we
cannot obtain a necessary or desirable license, can obtain such a license only on terms we consider to be unattractive or unacceptable, or if we are unable to redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid actual or potential patent or other
intellectual property infringement. Obtaining, protecting and defending patent and other intellectual property rights can be expensive and may require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel. An

probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit your

Protagenic has prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires Protagenic to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, Protagenic evaluates such estimates and judgments,
including those described in greater detail below. Protagenic bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that Protagenic believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>

not record allowance for doubtful accounts during the period of comparison. After the Company begins generating revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts will henceforth be based on our assessment of the experience, credit quality, age of the
accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer&#146;s ability to pay. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Stock-Based Compensation </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense consists of expenses for the granting of shares, stock options and issuance of warrants periodically by the
company. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at each grant date, based on the fair value of the award using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model (&#147;Black Scholes&#148;) when third party valuation is not available and are
recognized as an operating expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period, if applicable. Any unvested shares are re-measured at the end of each reporting period and adjusted accordingly, if material. All of the Company&#146;s
stock-based compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument. Stock based compensation totaled $172,630 in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, which is nearly a 200% increase from the $59,618 recorded in the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2014. Management expects that stock-based compensation expense will continue to rise as the Company grows and issues additional stock options, although at a lower rate of growth than it did from 2014 to 2015. </P>

ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. The increase of $122,458 is primarily due to the higher level of stock compensation expense, as more option grants occurred in 2015 than in 2014. Many other expense accounts actually decreased rather than increased
during this time, as the benchtop research was relatively slow in 2015 due to limitation of available operating funds. Salaries, legal fees, and direct R&amp;D expenses were all slightly less in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 than in
the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014. Management expects this trend to reverse in 2016, as the Company will begin spending from the proceeds of its expected equity financing, and begin a more expensive phase of its drug development,
including preclinical efficacy testing and toxicology testing in 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Research and Development Expenses </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development expenses decreased from $161,936 in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 to $151,812 in the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of a relatively constrained level of benchtop drug mechanism testing during 2015, influenced by the Company&#146;s constrained operating budget. The decrease would have been even
greater if it had not been for a concomitant reduction in the level of R&amp;D rebates the Company received from the Canadian government, which decreased from $78,366 in rebates in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 to just $8,630 in
rebates in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014. Patent filing expenses dropped significantly from $60,434 in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 to just $17,482 in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. This was because
the only patent-related legal expenses the company incurred in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 were from responding to USPTO office actions. Management expects that the Company is likely to file new patent applications in 2016 and
2017, and hence patent legal expense is likely to rise and may surpass its 2014 level. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>General and Administrative Expenses </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interest expense was negligible for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, the
Company incurred interest expense of $3,537, from interest on a loan made to the Company by the Company&#146;s co-founder and Chairman, Dr.&nbsp;Garo&nbsp;H. Armen, Management expects that in 2016 and thereafter, interest expense will return to

September&nbsp;30, 2015 was not sufficient working capital to fund the ongoing preclinical testing necessary to make significant progress toward preparing for a Phase I clinical trial of the Company&#146;s main drug product. Moreover, the
Company&#146;s sparse needs for an operating structure exceeded its ability to fund operations beyond the minimal corporate structure kept in place during both of these time periods, sufficient to keep some benchtop drug mechanism testing going, but
not sufficient to stay current with all of the Company&#146;s scientist consultants, legal counsel, and accountants. As a result, the Company borrowed funds from its co-founder and Chairman (accumulating debt payable to this stockholder of $217,686

2013 was a year in which more option grants occurred than in 2014. Direct research and development expenditures decreased during this time, from $178,018 in 2013 to $67,270 in 2014, driven down by the completion of various mechanistic tests in 2013.

with all of the Company&#146;s scientist consultants, legal counsel, and accountants. Management believes that the Company will have significantly more working capital during 2016-2017, due to the anticipated proceeds of one or more equity
financings. </P>

Directors be independent. However, in evaluating the independence of our members and the composition of the committees of our Board of Directors, our Board utilizes the definition of &#147;independence&#148; as that term is defined by applicable
listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market and SEC rules, including the rules relating to the independence standards of an audit committee and the non-employee director definition of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Board of Directors expects to continue to evaluate its independence standards and whether and to what extent the composition of the Board
and its committees meets those standards. We ultimately intend to appoint such persons to our Board and committees of our Board as are expected to be required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by a national securities exchange.
Therefore, we intend that a majority of our directors will be independent directors of which at least one director will qualify as an &#147;audit committee financial expert,&#148; within the meaning of Item&nbsp;407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, as
promulgated by the SEC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, our Board of Directors is expected to appoint an audit committee, governance committee and

entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. It is anticipated that future directors and officers will enter into an Indemnification Agreement with us in substantially similar form. The Indemnification

losses, costs, liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines, expenses and other matters that may result or arise in connection with such Indemnified Party serving in his or her capacity as a director of ours or serving at our direction as a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another entity. The Indemnification Agreement further provides that, upon an Indemnified Party&#146;s request, we will advance expenses to the Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable

burden of proving otherwise. The Indemnification Agreement also requires us to maintain in full force and effect directors&#146; liability insurance on the terms described in the Indemnification
Agreement. If indemnification under the Indemnification Agreement is unavailable to an Indemnified Party for any reason, we, in lieu of indemnifying the Indemnified Party, will contribute to any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances to reflect the relative benefits received or relative fault of the parties in connection with such
event. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers, and
controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in a successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to the court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. </P>

from January&nbsp;1, 2017 through December&nbsp;20, 2023. The other material terms of the New Warrants are substantially similar to those of the Predecessor Warrants. There was no physical exchange of Protagenic warrants for New Warrants; rather,
Protagenic warrants automatically converted into New Warrants in connection with the Transactions, and the New Warrants will automatically represent the right to purchase the same number of shares of our Common Stock following the Reverse Split.

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Trades in our Common Stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities
subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, broker/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the
purchaser&#146;s written agreement to the transaction before the sale. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC also has rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in
connection with transactions in &#147;penny stocks.&#148; Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities listed on certain national exchanges, provided that the current price and volume
information with respect to transactions in that security is provided by the applicable exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, before effecting a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to
deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer
quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#146;s account. The bid and offer
quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing before effecting the transaction, and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&#146;s
confirmation. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for shares of our Common Stock. As a result of these rules, investors may find it difficult to sell their shares. </P>

other transactions contemplated hereby and has no need for liquidity in its investment in the Interests. B.E. Global has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters in general, and with respect to businesses of a nature similar
to the business of MomSpot, so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of, and making an informed business decision with regard to, the acquisition of the Interests and the other transactions contemplated hereby. B.E. Global is acquiring
the Interests solely for its own account and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution or public offering thereof, within the meaning of any applicable securities laws and regulations, unless such distribution or offering
is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), or an exemption from such registration is available. B.E. Global has (i)&nbsp;received all the information it has deemed necessary to make an informed
decision with respect to the acquisition of the Interests and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (ii)&nbsp;had an opportunity to make such investigation as he has desired pertaining to MomSpot and the acquisition of an interest therein and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to verify the information which is, and has been, made available to him or her; and (iii)&nbsp;had the opportunity to ask questions of Seller concerning MomSpot. B.E. Global has received no public
solicitation or advertisement with respect to the offer or sale of the Interests. B.E. Global realizes that the Interests are &#147;restricted securities&#148; as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Securities Act, the resale of the Interests is restricted by federal and state securities laws and, accordingly, the Interests must be held indefinitely unless their resale is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an
exemption from such registration is available for their resale. B.E. Global understands that any resale of the Interests by him must be registered under the Securities Act (and any applicable state securities law) or be effected in circumstances
that, in the opinion of counsel for MomSpot at the time, create an exemption or otherwise do not require registration under the Securities Act (or applicable state securities laws). B.E. Global acknowledges and consents that certificates now or

business of the Subsidiaries, so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of, and making an informed business decision with regard to, the acquisition of the Interests and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer is acquiring the

registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), or an exemption from such registration is available. Buyer has (i)&nbsp;received all the information it has deemed necessary to make an informed decision with
respect to the acquisition of the Interests and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (ii)&nbsp;had an opportunity to make such investigation as he has desired pertaining to Subsidiaries and the acquisition of an interest therein and the other

advertisement with respect to the offer or sale of the Interests. Buyer realizes that the Interests are &#147;restricted securities&#148; as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities
Act, the resale of the Interests is restricted by federal and state securities laws and, accordingly, the Interests must be held indefinitely unless their resale is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available for their resale. Buyer understands that any resale of the Interests by him must be registered under the Securities Act (and any applicable state securities law) or be effected in circumstances that, in the opinion of
counsel for the applicable Subsidiary at the time, create an exemption or otherwise do not require registration under the Securities Act (or applicable state securities laws). Buyer acknowledges and consents that certificates now or hereafter issued

discretion, to engage professionals and direct the representation of Seller in connection with any such audit and the resolution thereof, without receiving the consent of Buyer or any other party acting on behalf of Buyer, provided that Seller will
not settle any such audit in a manner which would materially adversely affect Buyer after the Closing Date. In the event that after Closing any tax authority informs Buyer or any of the Subsidiaries of any notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment
or other dispute concerning an amount of taxes which pertain to Seller, or to the Subsidiaries during the period prior to Closing, Buyer must promptly notify Seller of the same within 15 calendar days of the date of the notice from the tax

provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Buyer shall (i)&nbsp;retain all books and records with respect to tax matters pertinent to the Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
to the extent notified by Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii)&nbsp;give Seller reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if Seller so requests, Buyer agrees to cause the Subsidiaries to allow Seller to take possession of such books and records. </P>

Participant) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Administrator in its discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be inconsistent with this Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be
deemed to give any Participant the right to have such Participant&#146;s ISOs converted into Non-Qualified Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Administrator takes appropriate action. The Administrator, with the consent
of the Participant, may also terminate any portion of any ISO that has not been exercised at the time of such conversion. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) The Company hereby grants to the Participant pursuant to the 2006 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) The Option is granted on the condition that the purchase of shares hereunder shall be for investment purposes and not with a view to resale
or distribution, except that such condition shall be inoperative if the offering of Shares subject to the Option is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or if in the opinion of counsel for the Company such Shares may be resold
without registration. At the time of the exercise of the Option or any installment thereof, the Participant will execute a Nonqualified Stock Option Exercise Form in the form attached as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;2</U> and such further agreements as the
Company may require to implement the foregoing condition and to acknowledge the Participant&#146;s familiarity with restrictions on the resale of the Shares under applicable securities laws, and the Company may stamp such legend on the certificate
representing the Shares as may be necessary or appropriate in light of the foregoing condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) The Company will furnish upon request
of the Participant copies of the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended (the &#147;<U>Certificate of Incorporation</U>&#148;), and bylaws of the Company, as amended (the &#147;<U>Bylaws</U>&#148;), such publicly available financial
and other information concerning the Company and its business and prospects as may be reasonably requested by the Participant in connection with exercise of this Option (and such other financial and other information concerning the Company as may be
required to be delivered to Optionees from time to time pursuant to applicable laws). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) The Option shall not be transferable otherwise
than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and except as provided in Section&nbsp;4 the Option shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant by the Participant only. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the
Participant is determined to be mentally incompetent and a guardian or conservator (or other similar person) is appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to manage the Participant&#146;s affairs, the guardian or conservator (or other similar
person) may exercise the Option on behalf of the Participant, provided that such exercise is made within the time limits prescribed herein. </P>

the Plan. To the extent that the terms, conditions and definitions of this Agreement are inconsistent with those of the Plan, those of this Agreement shall govern. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings defined in the
Plan. The Participant hereby accepts this Option subject to all such provisions of the Plan and agrees that all decisions under, and interpretations of, such provisions of the Plan by the Board, as defined in the Plan, shall be final, binding and

necessary to list upon official notice of issuance any shares to be issued pursuant to the Plan on a national securities exchange or market system or to register under the Securities Act of 1933 or other applicable federal or state statute any
shares to be issued pursuant to the Plan, or to qualify any such shares for exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or for similar exemption
under state law, then the Company shall notify the Participant to that effect and no Shares shall be issued until such registration, listing or exemption has been obtained. The Company shall make prompt application for any such registration, listing
or exemption pursuant to federal or state law or rules of such securities exchange which it deems necessary and shall make reasonable efforts to cause such registration, listing, or exemption to become and remain effective. </P>

to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company full payment in accordance with this Section of the amount necessary to pay the aggregate exercise price. Payment shall be made (a)&nbsp;in cash, (b)&nbsp;by check, (c)&nbsp;at such time as the Common
Stock is registered under the Exchange Act, by actual delivery or deemed delivery and assignment to the Company of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant which (i)&nbsp;have a Fair Market Value not less than the Option Price (as specified
on the signature page below), and (ii)&nbsp;have been owned by the Participant for at least six months prior to the date of delivery or deemed delivery of such shares (or such other period as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company&#146;s
earnings) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, (d)&nbsp;by such other consideration and method of payment approved by the Board or (e)&nbsp;by any combination of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Option
may not be exercised by delivery and assignment to the Company of shares of Common Stock to the extent that such delivery and assignment would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, or related regulation or rule, or any agreement or
Company policy, restricting the transfer or redemption of the Common Stock. For purposes of this Section, a deemed delivery of shares shall mean the offset by the Company of a number of shares subject to the Option against an equal number of shares
of the Common Stock owned by the Participant, which may be accomplished by attestation by the Participant as to such shares owned. The Company reserves the right to decline to approve any such procedure in the Company&#146;s sole and absolute
discretion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) The Company&#146;s obligation to deliver Shares upon exercise of an Option shall be subject to the Participant&#146;s
satisfaction of all applicable income and employment tax withholding obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any taxes of
any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any Shares issued upon exercise of the Option. Payment of withholding taxes may be made (i)&nbsp;by&nbsp;cash, (ii)&nbsp;when the Common Stock is registered under the Exchange Act, through the
surrender (by actual or deemed delivery) of shares of Common Stock which the Participant already owns and which, except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Board in any instance, have been owned by the Participant for at least six months prior
to the date of delivery or deemed delivery of such Shares (or such other period as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company&#146;s earnings) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, or (iii)&nbsp;to the extent of the
minimum applicable federal, state and local withholding rate only, through the surrender of shares of Common Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan, subject to the discretion of the Board to require payment in cash if it
determines that payment by other methods is not in the best interests of the Company. </P>

identification of eventual structural characterization of high affinity TCAP receptors are essential to develop a high sensitivity ligand-screening assay for the purpose of evaluating future TCAP peptide variants and ultimately as a high-throughput
testing platform to develop TCAP small molecule mimics.&nbsp;We have a unique advantage to develop a distinct receptor-screening assay by capitalizing on the use of the recently developed immortalized hypothalamic cell lines. We have screened these
cells for TCAP responsiveness and identified four cell lines that are responsive to TCAP as determined by cAMP modulation abilities. However, we have determined that cAMP is not a reliable endpoint as an evalution method. Many hormones can trigger
an increase in cAMP in some parts of the cell, for example neurites and axon hillock regions, but a decrease in dentrites. Thus using a monoculture of cells can lead to inconsistent results depending upon the confluency, passage and growth rate of
the cultured cells. Ligand-binding determinations are a more reliable determination as a first level of evalution of ligand activity because receptor activation is a prerequisite for downstream cellular activity such as cAMP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Experimental Design:</B> Plasma membrane preparations of four different mouse neuronal cell line cultures will be used to measure the affinity of mouse
TCAP-l for the endogenous receptor. Cells will be grown initially to 50 to 60% confluency, as we have previously determined that this cell density is the most consistent in terms of TCAP action using neurite outgrowth and cAMP as physiological
endpoints. Receptor affinity will be evaluated using two methods: 1) Scintillation proximity assays (SPA) and 2) radioreceptor assays. The scintillation assay has the advantage in that it is already designed to be a high throughput method. It has
the disadvantage in that it has a lower sensitivity than other methods, and so the optimization of the cell type and receptor expression level are key requirements for an effective method. We have used this method in the past with ectopically
expressed receptors in a rapidly growing cell line. The radioreceptor assay, on the other hand is highly sensitive and specific using a radiolabelled TCAP ligand. We have used this method in the past to evaluate small sequence changes in peptides
with a similar structure to TCAP. The disadvantage of this method is that it cannot be readily scaled up to a high-throughput level. Thus for the purposes of defining the level of TCAP receptor expression and its affinity for its ligand, both
methods are complementary. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Challenges and Interpretation:</B> Although we already possess cell lines with the TCAP receptor that can yield a measurable response, high levels of
receptor expression are essential for a sensitive screening assay. Endogenously expressed receptors may not be expressed at a level that is viable for a screening assay that can be scaled up to a high-throughput type level. In this case, it may be
necessary to explore additional heterologous systems where the TCAP receptor is ectopically expressed in for example non-neural cells using a vector system incorporating a high expression promotor (e.g. CMV). We have utilized a similar system in the
past to evaluate novel peptide designs and, therefore, have the experience to develop this further, if necessary. Our preliminary investigations also indicate that the affinity of the TCAP receptor may be altered by the presence of GPCR-modulating
proteins, particularly the RAMP proteins. Thus, if using a heterologous expression system, the appropriate RAMP may have to be coexpressed. Alternatively, if receptor levels are of sufficiently high levels in the homologous neuronal systems, then
using the appropriate cell line with the requisite accessory proteins will be essential. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Timelines </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The setting up and optimization of the receptor assay systems are expected to take about 2 months. Determination of the appropriate cell lines are expected to
take 2-4 months depending of the data obtained. Within this period we will know whether an endogenously expressed receptor system or an ectopically expressed receptor system is more sensitive to evaluate the compounds. About 2 to 4 months will be
required to evaluate the levels of TCAP bound protein in the responsive cell lines. A number of the project goals can be done in parallel to each other such that about 6 months will be required to answer these questions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Personnel:</B> An entry-level post-doctoral scientist with a background in molecular pharmacology will be responsible for the setting up and optimization
of the assay, as well as the analysis of the peptide binding curves. This individual will also be responsible for organizing the testing regimens and in consultation with Dr.&nbsp;Lovejoy making the decision on the appropriate cell lines and
preparing the data reports. A junior research assistant is will be required for the preparation and maintenance of the cell lines as well as assist as necessary in the preparation of the cell and membrane extracts. The scientist in training, Arij Al
Chawaf, presently a Ph.D student in Dr.&nbsp;Lovejoy&#146;s laboratory, who has been developing the receptor characterization assays will evaluate the cell lines selected for the purification of the receptor using photoaffinity crosslinking
purification. </P>

identification of eventual structural characterization of high affinity TCAP receptors are essential to develop a high sensitivity ligand-screening assay for the purpose of evaluating future TCAP peptide variants and ultimately as a high-throughput
testing platform to develop TCAP small molecule mimics. We have a unique advantage to develop a distinct receptor-screening assay by capitalizing on the use of the recently developed immortalized hypothalamic cell lines. We have screened these cells
for TCAP responsiveness and identified four cell lines that are responsive to TCAP as determined by cAMP modulation abilities. However, we have determined that cAMP is not a reliable endpoint as an evalution method. Many hormones can trigger an
increase in cAMP in some parts of the cell, for example neurites and axon hillock regions, but a decrease in dentrites. Thus using a monoculture of cells can lead to inconsistent results depending upon the confluency, passage and growth rate of the
cultured cells. Ligand-binding determinations are a more reliable determination as a first level of evalution of ligand activity because receptor activation is a prerequisite for downstream cellular activity such as cAMP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Experimental Design: </B>Plasma membrane preparations of four different mouse neuronal cell line cultures will be used to measure the affinity of mouse
TCAP-l for the endogenous receptor. Cells will be grown initially to 50 to 60% confluency, as we have previously determined that this cell density is the most consistent in terms of TCAP action using neurite outgrowth and cAMP as physiological
endpoints. Receptor affinity will be evaluated using two methods: 1) Scintillation proximity assays (SPA) and 2) radioreceptor assays. The scintillation assay has the advantage in that it is already designed to be a high throughput method. It has
the disadvantage in that it has a lower sensitivity than other methods, and so the optimization of the cell type and receptor expression level are key requirements for an effective method. We have used this method in the past with ectopically
expressed receptors in a rapidly growing cell line. The radioreceptor assay, on the other hand is highly sensitive and specific using a radiolabelled TCAP ligand. We have used this method in the past to </P>

evaluate small sequence changes in peptides with a similar structure to TCAP. The disadvantage of this method is that it cannot be readily scaled up to a high-throughput level. Thus for the
purposes of defining the level of TCAP receptor expression and its affinity for its ligand, both methods are complementary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Goal 1: Determination

already possess cell lines with the TCAP receptor that can yield a measurable response, high levels of receptor expression are essential for a sensitive screening assay. Endogenously expressed receptors may not be expressed at a level that is viable
for a screening assay that can be scaled up to a high-throughput type level. In this case, it may be necessary to explore additional heterologous systems where the TCAP receptor is ectopically expressed in for example non-neural cells using a vector
system incorporating a high expression promotor (e.g. CMV). We have utilized a similar system in the past to evaluate novel peptide designs and, therefore, have the experience to develop this further, if necessary. Our preliminary investigations
also indicate that the affinity of the TCAP receptor may be altered by the presence of GPCR-modulating proteins, particularly the RAMP proteins. Thus, if using a heterologous expression system, the appropriate RAMP may have to be coexpressed.
Alternatively, if receptor levels are of sufficiently high levels in the homologous neuronal systems, then using the appropriate cell line with the requisite accessory proteins will be essential. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Strategy and Goals </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The aim is to establish a complete
physiological model of TCAP action from exogenous administration to the onset of behaviour with the goal to establish the feasibility of TCAP treatment on hospitalized patients suffering from severe depression or anxiety. Several experiments are
proposed to fill in the gaps where the understanding of TCAP action is not complete. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the completion of these studies, we should be able to determine
the best method to administer TCAP, its longevity in vivo (biological half-life), its uptake in the brain, its mode of action on key sites in the brain and how it targets the CRF-mediated anxiogenic system, its actions on behavioural tests.
Moreover, its actions on behavioural tests should allow predictions as to whether TCAP will be most appropriate for treating depression or anxiety. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Proposed Experiments </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Development of New Assay
Systems </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to enhance our understanding of the actions of TCAP two new assay systems will be developed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Forced Swim Test:</U> Presently, our behavioural analyses are designed to evaluate the anxiolytic or anxiogenic aspects of bioreactive agents. However, the
forced swim test is the industry standard test for evaluating whether an agent has the potential to modify the incidence of depression. This method is presently not being used in-house and therefore we need to purchase the necessary equipment and
validate the test on TCAP treated animals in comparison to animals treated with agents known to enhance depression. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>TCAP Radioimmunoassay</U>: In
addition, the accurate detection of TCAP in the blood stream may be a powerful tool to determine if individuals are predisposed to the incidence of depression and anxiety or are suffering from a condition associated with TCAP dysregulation.
Moreover, a TCAP detection assay will allow for an understanding of the biological halflife of TCAP and in the future could be used to monitor patients undergoing TCAP treatment. If TCAP can be reliably detected in plasma then we envision using the
ratio of plasma TCAP concentrations to known anxiogenic hormones such as CRF, ACTH and cortisol as a diagonostic means to detect the incidence of depression and anxiety. We have already raised three TCAP-specific antisera, and possess the necessary
equipment to put this assay together. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Presently most studies have focused on direct injection of TCAP into the brain using indwelling cannulae. Pilot studies indicate that intravenous injection is
a viable method, although a full set of behavioural experiments to ascertain this have not been performed. In addition, subcutaneous injection has not been investigated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TCAP will be administered either as a single injection IV or SC to determine acute effects, or as one injection each day over five days to determine chronic
actions. The acoustic startle response, elevated plus maze, swim test behaviour locomotion and body weight changes will be examined </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Biological
Half-life </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nothing is presently known about the longevity of TCAP in vivo. A structural analysis of the peptide predicts that TCAP is modified for
circulation in the blood stream. Two sets of experiments are designed to answer these questions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Synthetic TCAP will be incubated in rat plasma, and its
breakdown by proteolytic enzymes will be determined by examining the loss of immunoreactive signal on a high resolution polyacrylamide gel using TCAP-specific antisera over a 2 to 8 hour period. The length of time will be based on its rate of
breakdown in the first 1 to 2 hours of the study. This will allow us to understand the plasma component of TCAP degradation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon completion of the above
experiments, TCAP will be injected intravenously into rats and the presence of TCAP in tissues and the brain will be examined by radioimmunoassay. TCAP expression </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Tissue partitioning Studies </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pilot studies on IV
injected TCAP reveal that this mode of administration induces behavioural changes consistent with the actions of neurally injected TCAP. This implies that TCAP is moving across the blood brain barrier to gain access into the brain, but does not rule
out an indirect action of TCAP on other organ systems that possess a feedback action on the brain, for example the adrenal cortex. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TCAP uptake in the
brain will be examined directly by the expression of labelled TCAP in the brain after IV injection of labelled TCAP. Any major modification of the TCAP sequence either by adding a novel epitope or by chemoluminescent tagging will likely modify TCAP
uptake by putative transporter and receptor systems. Thus a radiolabel tag will likely be employed. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The acoustic startle response studies indicate that TCAP may act directly on its own receptor to induce an anxiolytic response or alternatively may act as an
antagonist on the CRF-receptor system to inhibit the actions of CRF. These studies are designed whether TCAP can directly inhibit the actions of CRF acutely or chronically through the CRF-R1 receptor system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TCAP and CRF will be coinjected IV at varying concentrations to determine actions on ACTH release from the pituitary and cortisol release from the adrenal
cortex. Previous studies by our laboratories indicate that TCAP by itself does not induce cortisol release. However a non-significant but compelling decrease in plasma cortisol was observed in animals treated with TCAP. These studies will be
repeated in vitro using a cell line that possesses the CRF-R1 receptor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Project Costs </B></P>

functional regions in a peptide by examining the structure of orthologous peptides across taxa, and the structure of paralogous peptides within taxa. STORM is unique from other algorithmic methods to predict structure by its use of comparative
phylogenetic information to determine the probability of particular amino acid substitutions within a sequence. Thus STORM utilizes animal phylogeny models based on both palaeontological data as well as molecular data. This information is used to
construct a hypothetical functional ancestor where sets of common amino acid motifs are identified. The sequence and relative position of the motifs are used to search databases for related sequences. STORM can therefore be used to discover new
bioactive proteins and peptides, new functions of known peptides and proteins, functional regions within peptides and proteins, and to design new peptides with novel properties. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The STORM algorithm can be used to identify new peptide hormones, their receptors and regulatory proteins. These in tum can be used as targets for the
development of new pharmacological therapeutics. STORM can also be used to design amino acid (ie peptide) based drugs. With respect to basic science STORM can be used to identify previously unknown paralogous peptide and proteins to understand the
physiological regulation of a particular system and also help establish the phylogenetic interrelationships of species. Thus the STORM algorithm is likely to be of interest to scientists in both commercial and academic settings. </P>

other tissues. It acts to regulate cell metabolism via a unique mechanism associated with activation of the dystroglycan complex leading to a signal transduction cascade to increase the number of glucose transporters in the cell membrane thereby
increasing the transport of glucose into the cell. This action leads to significantly higher cellular energy in the form of increased cellular ATP levels. At the organismal level, single doses of TCAP-1 at 300 and 3000 pmoles significantly decrease
blood glucose levels as long as one week later. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>5. Have there been any prior disclosures (abstracts, presentations, publications) in respect of this

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TCAP-l is a 41 amino acid peptide derived from a natural protein (teneurin) found in the human reproductive organs and other tissues. It acts
to regulate cell metabolism via a unique mechanism associated with activation of the dystroglycan complex. In the male reproductive system the teneurin-dystroglycan complex is associated with regions of the testes and epididymis that play a role in
spermatozoa formation, maturation and viability. In vivo studies indicate that synthetic TCAP-l modifies testicular and epididymal morphology increases testes size and increases testosterone production. These effects are consistent with increased
activity of the reproductive system in mate mice. However because the peptide and hormone system is highly conserved in all mammals as well as vertebrates in general, these studies suggest that synthetic TCAP-l has potential to be used to treat some
forms of male infertility in humans as well as other species. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAP) were reported in 2004 by our laboratory and consisted of a family of four bioactive peptides in mammals (Qian et al., 2004). We subsequently showed that the TCAP-l paralogue was highly efficacious at
inhibiting anxiety as determined by the acoustic startle response in rats (Wang et al., 2005; Lovejoy et al., 2006; 2009). Further studies indicated that these peptides inhibited the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) facilitation of anxiety using
a number of behavioural models (Al Chawaf, 2007; Tan et al., 2008; 2011; 2012; Rotzinger et al., 2010). In addition, TCAP-1 could inhibit CRF-associated neuronal activation in key regions of the brain associated with emotion (Tan et al., 2009b).
Based on the inhibitory actions of TCAP-I on CRF, subsequent studies established that TCAP-I could also inhibit the CRF-induced facilitation of cocaine addiction (Kupferschmidt et al. 2011). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the same period, we showed that TCAP-1 had a neuroprotective effect on neurons and was associated with neurotrophic activity (Trubiani et al., 2007, Ng
et al., 2010) and that the peptide played a role with aerobic metabolism. However, associated with these actions were increased neuronal process formation (Al Chawaf et al., 2007b: Tan et al., 2009a; 2011). The cloning of the gene, and
identification of the receptor mechanism and associated signal transduction system required for process development was recently established (Chand el al., 2012; 2013c) thereby establishing the independence of the TCAP-l system. Further studies
confirmed the evolution of the TCAP-l peptide as a distinct signalling entity (Chand et al., 2013d) that played a role in cellular metabolism. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Taken together, these studies indicated that TCAP-l played a major role in the regulation of cellular metabolism
and were most active in highly metabolic cells such as the brain (Chand et al., 2013b) and reproductive organs (Chand et al., 2013a). We have now established that TCAP-l increases energy production in cells by an insulin-independent increase in
glucose transport and energy transduction in both neurons and skeletal muscle, and further, may play a role in male reproductive function. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Therefore,
these findings indicate that TCAP-l likely exerts its neuroprotective and neurological effects by increasing energy usage in brain cells to effectively increase the stress threshold of these cells. Further studies indicate that it likely has similar
effects throughout the organism to increase the efficiency of glucose and energy metabolism. Thus, this peptide has applications to a wide variety of pathological disorders associated with energy metabolism that include neurological pathology,
glucose availability such as diabetes, reproductive disorders such as infertility and muscular disorders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cited References: </I></B></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>In vitro Studies:</U> A combination of in vitro models using immortalized cell culture and tissue sections
will be used to ascertain the molecular mechanism TCAP-l utilizes to regulate energy production. This will be aimed at establishing the independence of TCAP-1 from the insulin signal transduction pathway and will support the studies associated with
the Metabolism project (above). Moreover, these studies will provide information to interpret safety studies are part of the IND enabling program. Most of these studies are now complete for neurons. Similar studies are being carried out in skeletal
muscle cells. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additional in vitro studies utilizing recombinant DNA methods to express TCAP in immortalized cells will be used to determine how TCAP is
regulated and processed and is expected to provide insight into the type of pathologies that TCAP is involved in. Currently, the specific mRNA has been cloned and a mouse-based knockdown of TCAP-1 will be prepared. This model will be useful to
assess all elements of TCAP-1 action including neurological and behavioural regulation, metabolism and infertility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Blood hormone/metabolite
study:</U> The goal of these studies is to assess the acute actions of TCAP-l on metabolic parameters. In this study, rats will be given either vehicle, or one of two doses of TCAP-1 (25 or 250 pmols). Blood will be collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120
and 240 minutes later. Insulin, glucose, triglycerides, glucagon, leptin will be determined for each time point. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>2. Skeletal Muscle

muscle fiber density, and is associated with insulin-independent glucose uptake. Moreover, TCAP-l immunoreactivity and binding is concentrated in regions of the neuromuscular junction. New studies are designed to establish how muscle fiber growth is
regulated by TCAP-l both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo studies will be used to establish how TCAP-1 treatment can regulate muscle contractility and determine whether tissue damage is reduced by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TCAP-1.</FONT> </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>In vivo Studies:</U> The effect of TCAP-l using intravenous administration under a variety of conditions will be used to determine the efficacy of TCAP-1 on
the inhibition of cocaine seeking reinstatement in rats. These studies are currently underway in the laboratory of Dr.&nbsp;Suzanne Erb. Further studies will be aimed at determining the molecular and neural pathways by which this mechanism occurs.
Based on previous data, we hypothesize that TCAP-1 regulates cocaine addiction by altering the dopaminergic pathway associated with reward. Thus these new studies are aimed at determining the co-localization of the TCAP-1 system with that of the
dopaminergic pathway. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Protagenic
Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiary </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiary as of
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss), stockholders&#146; (deficit) equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiary&#146;s
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Protagenic
Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 and the results of their consolidated operations and their consolidated cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern. The Company has continued to incur net (losses), has an accumulated (deficit) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and its principal operations have not yet commenced. These factors among others create a substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Schulman

U.S.A.&#148;) was organized on September&nbsp;29, 2004 in the State of Delaware. On September&nbsp;14, 2015, PTI U.S.A. obtained its renewal and revival of its Delaware charter which had become inoperative effective August&nbsp;7, 2015. The Company
is a privately held biotechnology company focused on the discovery, research and development of pre-clinical studies for developing novel, naturally occurring, human neuropeptide-based, brain-active therapeutics for treatment of depression, mood,
anxiety and other neurodegenerative disorders. The Company is also interested in acquiring exclusive intellectual property rights for peptide-based therapeutics for the treatment of neurological and mood disorders. Once the Company&#146;s planned
principal operations commence, its focus will be licensing certain technologies and the continued research of the new technologies. </P>

going concern since the Company is dependent on its ability to obtain additional capital or obtain short term financing and actually commence its operations to fund the Company&#146;s long-term plans. The Company has incurred net (losses) of
($302,481) and ($936,996) for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, resulting in an accumulated (deficit) of ($5,461,933) and ($5,159,452) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The success of the Company is
dependent upon obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, bringing its products to market and achieving profitable operations. The continuation of the research and development programs and the commercialization of its products are dependent upon
the Company&#146;s ability to successfully complete these activities and to obtain adequate financing through a combination of financing activities and operations. No assurances can be given that management of the Company will be successful in its
efforts. The Company&#146;s existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund its operations, working capital and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be not able to continue as a going concern. These factors among others create a substantial
doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Liquidity </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The assets and liabilities of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiary PTI Canada are translated into U.S. dollars from its functional currency
using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheets date. Additionally, the accounts on the statements of operations are translated using exchange rates approximating average rates prevailing during the years. Translation adjustments that arise
from translating its financial statements from the local currency to the U.S. dollar are accumulated and reflected as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity (deficit). Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, PTI U.S.A. recorded an accumulated translation loss of $147,581 which converts to CA$
170,251. At December&nbsp;31, 2013, PTI U.S.A. recorded an accumulated translation gain of $8,757 which converts to CA$ 9,315. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain
amounts pertaining to the Canada Revenue Agency included in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements may be in Canada dollars (denoted as &#147;CA$&#148;). If not denoted with CA$, then all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars
(as &#147;$&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 49% and 3%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s cash and cash
equivalent balances was translated to U.S. dollars since the amount was maintained with PTI Canada. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, 100% of the prepaid research and development expenses were translated to U.S. dollars since it was paid by and
maintained with PTI Canada. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accruals, contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and valuation of stock options and warrants. These estimates may be adjusted as more current
information becomes available, and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cash equivalents consist of money market instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company maintains its
cash and cash equivalents with two high credit quality financial institutions with one located in each the United States and Canada, which at times, may be in excess of insured amounts with the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Company. The
Company&#146;s policy is to maintain its cash and cash equivalents with reputable financial institutions assessed on an annual basis. </P>

stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Improvements and replacements of equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of equipment are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired, their
cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation is computed using straight-line methods over their estimated useful lives ranging
from 3 to 5 years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Treasury Stock </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2013, the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $.10 per share for a total cost of $100,000. Management of the Company
does not plan to retire the stock and applies the cost method to its treasury stock transactions. Differences between proceeds for reissuance of treasury stock and the cost are credited or charged to additional paid in capital to the extent of the
prior credits and thereafter to accumulated deficit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Financial Instruments </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and their subsequent measurements are determined in accordance
with their classification. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired or issued and their characteristics. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as held-for-trading assets and are reported at fair
value. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other liabilities and after initial recognition are recorded at amortized cost. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant differences between the carrying
values of these amounts and their estimated fair values due to their short-term nature. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Rebates from Research and Development Credits

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense consists of expenses for the granting of shares, stock options and issuance of warrants periodically by the
Company. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at each grant date, based on the fair value of the award using a Black Scholes Merton option pricing model (&#147;Black Scholes&#148;) when third party valuation is not available and are recognized
as an operating expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period, if applicable. Any unvested shares are re-measured at the end of each reporting period and adjusted accordingly, if material. All of the Company&#146;s stock-based
compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Advertising Costs </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company had no advertising expenses during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and
2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Income Taxes </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for
differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the
carting amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management has determined that
a valuation allowance is required for the deferred tax assets which is primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes. The net operating losses expire through 2034 and 2021 for federal and state taxes,
respectively. Thus, the consolidated financial statements do not reflect a deferred tax provision. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Accounting for Uncertain Tax
Positions </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company follows the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which provides clarification on
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and also provides guidance on de-recognition, clarification, interests and penalties, disclosure and transition. The Company&#146;s only major tax jurisdictions are the
United States, New York and Canada. At December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, no significant income tax uncertainties have been included in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No interest or penalties were recorded for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013. In addition, the Company currently has no federal or state tax
examinations in progress. Tax returns are generally subject to potential examination for three years after filing. </P>

the common stock equivalents for each period. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, there were 2,126,674 and 1,821,670, respectively, potentially dilutive securities not included in the calculation of weighted-average shares of common

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2014-09, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606),&#148; which is the new, comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The standard&#146;s core principle is that a
company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The
Company currently has no revenues and does not expect any impact of adopting this guidance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, ASU 2014-10 removed the
definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Account Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In
addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for the development stage entities to (1)&nbsp;present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations, cash flow, and shareholder equity, (2)&nbsp;label the financial statements as
those of a development stage entity, (3)&nbsp;disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4)&nbsp;disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in
prior years it had been in the development stage. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this ASU effective with
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage information </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, &#147;Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the
Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.&#148; This ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects
vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption
of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. </P>

adjusted for transaction costs. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for

automatically or ranging from a one year period to a five year period. The shares are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. The Plan provides that qualified options be granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market
value at the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. On March&nbsp;1, 2014, the Company granted a total of 240,000 options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The 2014

volatility factor in valuing the Company&#146;s common stock equivalents by starting with its historical volatility adjusted for the volatility of equity interests from comparable publicly traded and privately held published companies to arrive at

is a privately held biotechnology company focused on the discovery, research and development of pre-clinical studies for developing novel, naturally occurring, human neuropeptide-based, brain- active therapeutics for treatment of depression, mood,
anxiety and other neurodegenerative disorders. The Company is also interested in acquiring exclusive intellectual property rights for peptide-based therapeutics for the treatment of neurological and mood disorders. Once the Company&#146;s planned

going concern since the Company is dependent on its ability to obtain additional capital, short term financing or merging and actually commence its operations to fund the Company&#146;s long-term plans. The Company has incurred net (losses) of
($394,878) and ($244,526) for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, resulting in an accumulated (deficit) of ($5,856,811) as of September&nbsp;30, 2015. The success of the Company is dependent upon obtaining the
necessary regulatory approvals, bringing its products to market and achieving profitable operations. The continuation of the research and development programs and the commercialization of its products are dependent upon the Company&#146;s ability to
successfully complete these activities and to obtain adequate financing through a combination of financing activities and operations. No assurances can be given that management of the Company will be successful in its efforts. The Company&#146;s
existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund its operations, working capital and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be not able to continue as a going concern. These factors among others create a substantial doubt about the
Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Liquidity </B></P>

using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheets date. Additionally, the accounts on the statements of operations are translated using exchange rates approximating average rates prevailing during the years. Translation adjustments that arise
from translating its financial statements from the local currency to the U.S. dollar are accumulated and reflected as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity (deficit). Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, PTI U.S.A. recorded an accumulated translation loss of $131,772 which converts to CA

contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and valuation of stock options and warrants. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded

value. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other liabilities and after initial recognition are recorded at amortized cost. As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, there were no significant differences between the carrying values of
these amounts and their estimated fair values due to their short-term nature. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Rebates from Research and Development Credits </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for
differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the
carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management has determined
that a valuation allowance is required for the deferred tax assets which is primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes. The net operating losses expire through 2035 and 2022 for federal and state
taxes, respectively. Thus, the consolidated financial statements do not reflect a deferred tax provision. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Accounting for Uncertain
Tax Positions </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company follows the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which provides clarification
on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and also provides guidance on de- recognition, clarification, interests and penalties, disclosure and transition. The Company&#146;s only major tax jurisdictions are the
United States, New York and Canada. At September&nbsp;30, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, no significant income tax uncertainties have been included in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize
interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No interest or penalties were recorded for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014. In addition, the Company
currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress. Tax returns are generally subject to potential examination for three years after filing. </P>

company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The
Company currently has no revenues and does not expect any impact of adopting this guidance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, ASU 2014-10 removed the
definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Account Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In
addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for the development stage entities to (1)&nbsp;present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations, cash flow, and shareholder equity, (2)&nbsp;label the financial statements as
those of a development stage entity, (3)&nbsp;disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4)&nbsp;disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in
prior years it had been in the development stage. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014, and interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU effective with the
December&nbsp;31, 2014 consolidated audited financial statements resulting in the removal of previously required development stage information. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:10%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, &#147;Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the
Terms of an Award Provide for a Performance Target.&#148; This ASU provides more explicit guidance for share-based awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period
as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. </P>

requires management to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new
standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this new standard for the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017 and the

bridge loan agreements for total borrowings of $310,000 with the executive director, chairman &#150; board of directors and major stockholder of PTI U.S.A. and director of PTI Canada (the &#147;Major Stockholder and Chairman&#148;). The proceeds
were used to fund research, development and the general operating activity of the Company. The loan bore interest at a rate of 10% per annum. On February 15, 2013, upon completion of the next fundraising round, the loan and accrued interest of
$317,789 were converted into a fixed number of 953,367 warrants to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at the purchase price of $1.00 per share (converted at 3 warrants for each $1.00). The Company did not enter into any bridge loan
arrangements during 2014. During January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the Company had entered into a series of bridge loan arrangements for total borrowings received of approximately $214,000 with the Major Stockholder and Chairman. The last
installment due under the September 1, 2015 bridge loan arrangement of $45,851 was received by the Company on October 20, 2015. The proceeds were once again used to fund research, development and the general operating activity of the Company. The
Company has guaranteed the payment of all principal and interest in the form of the Company&#146;s common stock at a purchase price of $1.25 per share. The loan bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The Company recorded interest expense of

employees, directors or consultants options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock which vest automatically or ranging from a one year period to a five year period. The shares are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date
of grant. The Plan provides that qualified options be granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, the
Company granted a total of 490,000 and 116,667 respectively, options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 and $1.00 per share. The 2015 and 2014 options vest monthly ranging from six months to over a

estimate the fair value of the common stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for options using this calculated value method. Based on the fact that the Company is a privately held company
with no revenue, management has estimated its expected future equity volatility factor in valuing the Company&#146;s common stock equivalents by starting with its historical volatility adjusted for the volatility of equity interests from comparable
publicly traded and privately held published companies to arrive at such industry benchmarks to evaluate. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">Introduction to Unaudited Pro forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February 12, 2016 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;), Atrinsic Inc a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into and closed an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), with Protagenic Acquisiiton Corp, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#147;Subsidiary&#148;) and Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(&#147;PTI&#148;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i)&nbsp;the Subsidiary merged into PTI such that PTI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and (ii)&nbsp;the Company issued 6,612,838 shares (the &#147;Acquisition Shares&#148;), of
the Company&#146;s Series B Preferred stock to the shareholders of PTI, representing approximately 68.1% of the Company&#146;s aggregate issued and outstanding common stock following the closing of the Merger Agreement, assuming conversion of the
Series B Preferred Stock on the basis of 15,463.7183 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Merger, as of
the Closing Date the Company entered into and closed subscription agreements with accredited investors (the &#147;Investors&#148;), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 2,775,000 shares of Series B Preferred stock to the
Investors for an aggregate purchase price of $3,468,750 (the &#147;Private Placement&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Including the 3,403,367 warrants and the 1,807,744 options
to purchase Series B Preferred Stock issued to the shareholders of PTI, the shareholders of PTI will own 76.8% of the company on a fully-diluted basis following the Merger assuming conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock on the basis of
15,463.7183 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the fact that after the Merger, (i)&nbsp;the former stockholders of
PTI control the Company, (ii)&nbsp;the officers and directors of PTI have become the Company&#146;s officers and directors, (iii)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s only business is the business that had been previously conducted by PTI for accounting
purposes, PTI is treated as the acquirer. The acquisition will be accounted for as a &#147;reverse merger&#148; and recapitalization since the sellers of PTI will control the combined company immediately following the completion of the Merger.
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the financial statements in this report filed on Form 8-K are those of PTI and are recorded at the historical cost basis of PTI The Company&#146;s assets,
liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets, liabilities and results of operations of PTI after consummation of the Merger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the Merger and the Private
Placement. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined <B>balance sheet</B> as of September&nbsp;30, 2015 combines the unaudited condensed balance sheet of the Company as of September&nbsp;30, 2015 with the unaudited condensed balance sheet
of PTI giving effect to the transactions described in the Merger Agreement as if they had occurred on September&nbsp;30, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following unaudited
pro forma condensed combined <B>statement of operations</B> for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 combines the unaudited condensed statement of operations of the Company for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 with the
unaudited condensed results of operations of PTI for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, giving effect to the transactions described in the Merger Agreement as if they had occurred on January&nbsp;1, 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined <B>statement of operations</B> for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 combines the condensed statement
of operations of the Company for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 with the condensed results of operations of PTI for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, giving effect to the transactions described in the Merger Agreement as if they had
occurred on January&nbsp;1, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The information presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements does not purport to
represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the Merger and Private Placement occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of our future financial position or results of operations for any period.
You should not rely on this information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that the combined company will experience after the Merger and Private
Placement were consummated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances. For example, the company&#146;s historical income statement figures for the 12-month period ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 were derived from June&nbsp;30th fiscal year data with the assumption that expenses incurred in the
12-months ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 occurred evenly distributed over each 6-month period. These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes and assumptions and the
historical financial statements and related notes of Atrinsic and PTI which are included elsewhere in this Form 8-K. </P>
