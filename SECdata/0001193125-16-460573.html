2016, Alta Mesa Holdings, LP, a Texas limited partnership (the &#147;Company&#148;) and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a third lien senior secured term loan agreement (the &#147;Third Priority Lien Credit Agreement&#148;)

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company may prepay all or a portion of the Term Loans at a prepayment price (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of: (i)&nbsp;105.313% after the second

Statement, dated February 11, 2016 (&#147;Offer to Exchange&#148;). A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This notice shall not

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company is providing herewith the following information and &#147;Risk Factor&#148; in connection with the
Company&#146;s business that are contained in the confidential Offer to Exchange related to the Exchange Offer: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not yet available, and data with respect to our cumulative production for the fourth quarter of 2015 are also not available. However, we are currently projecting average daily production during the
fourth quarter of 2015 of 17 to 18 MBoe per day as compared to an average 18.4 MBoe per day for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decline is primarily due to the Eagle Ford divestiture. We are also projecting total revenues of $88&nbsp;million
to $92&nbsp;million for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $180 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decline is due both to reduced prices received for oil and gas sales and the Eagle Ford divestiture. In addition, we are currently
projecting Adjusted EBITDAX of $54 million to $58 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, which includes a non-recurring gain of $18 to $20 million due to hedge unwinds and an adjustment to general and administrative expense due to a decrease in
bonus estimates, as compared to $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preliminary financial results and other financial data
presented above are subject to the completion of our year-end financial closing procedures. Those procedures have not been completed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These preliminary estimates are not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2015 or
the year ended December 31, 2015, and our actual results for such periods may differ materially from these preliminary estimates due to the completion of our year-end financial closing procedures, final adjustments and completion of the audit of our
financial statements. In connection with the completion of these activities, we may identify items that would require us to make adjustments to these preliminary estimates, which may be material. There can be no assurance that these estimates will
be realized, and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are not within our control. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on such estimates. We do not undertake any obligation to update these preliminary
estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risk Factor</B> </P>

established on units containing the acreage. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five
years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. Although the majority of our reserves are located on leases that are held by production, we do have
provisions in some of our leases that provide for the lease to expire unless certain conditions are met, such as drilling having commenced on the lease or production in paying quantities having been obtained within a defined time period. If
commodity prices remain low or we are unable to fund our anticipated capital program there is a risk that some of our existing proved reserves and some of our unproved inventory could be subject to lease expiration or a requirement to incur
additional leasehold costs to extend the lease. This could result in a reduction in our reserves and our growth opportunities (or the incurrence of significant costs). Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling
plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment,
gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, Exhibit 99.2 contains certain unaudited pro forma

operations as of September&nbsp;30, 2015. The unaudited pro&nbsp;forma financial information is based upon currently available information, assumptions and estimates which the Company believes are reasonable. These assumptions and estimates,
however, are subject to change. In the Company&#146;s opinion, all adjustments have been made that are necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro&nbsp;forma combined financial information. The unaudited pro&nbsp;forma financial information is

Maturing in 2021 </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">HOUSTON, TEXAS, February 11, 2016 &#150; Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (&#147;Alta Mesa&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) today announced
that it has commenced a private offer to exchange (the &#147;Exchange Offer&#148;), upon the terms and conditions set forth in a confidential offer to exchange and consent solicitation statement and a related letter of transmittal, each dated
February&nbsp;11, 2016 (together, the &#147;Offer to Exchange and Solicitation Statement&#148;), any and all of its outstanding 9&nbsp;5/8% senior notes due 2018 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) held by Eligible Holders (as defined below), for new
10&nbsp;5/8% senior secured third lien term loans of Alta Mesa maturing in 2021 (the &#147;Term Loans&#148;), and that it is seeking consents to amend certain provisions of the indenture relating to the Notes (the &#147;Indenture&#148;). <B>Receipt
of the consents required to amend the Indenture is not a condition to the consummation of the Exchange Offer, and the Exchange Offer may be consummated even if the requisite consents are not received.</B> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Term Loans will be made pursuant to a third lien senior secured term loan agreement (the &#147;Third Priority Lien Credit Agreement&#148;) entered into on
February&nbsp;11, 2016 by the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent. Term Loans made pursuant to the Third Priority Lien Credit Agreement will have a maturity date of March&nbsp;15, 2021, and will bear interest
at a rate of 10&nbsp;5/8% per annum. The Term Loans will be secured on a third-priority basis on substantially all of the assets of Alta Mesa and its subsidiaries and any Notes that remain outstanding after the Exchange Offer will be effectively
subordinated to all of the Company&#146;s secured indebtedness, including Term Loans, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. The Term Loans will also be guaranteed by certain of the Company&#146;s
subsidiaries and its general partner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Exchange Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March&nbsp;10, 2016, unless extended by Alta
Mesa (the &#147;Expiration Time&#148;). For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered, not validly withdrawn and accepted for exchange by the Company at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February&nbsp;25, 2016 (as it may be
extended, the &#147;Early Participation Time&#148;), Eligible Holders will be eligible to receive the &#147;Total Exchange Consideration&#148; set forth in the table below, which includes the &#147;Early Participation Premium&#148; of $50 in
principal amount of Term Loans per $1,000 of Notes. For each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for exchange by the Company after the Early Participation Time and at or prior to the Expiration Time, Eligible Holders
will be eligible to receive only the &#147;Exchange Consideration&#148; set forth in the table below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table sets forth the Exchange

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This press release includes &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act, and Section&nbsp;21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, regarding Alta Mesa&#146;s strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and
objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this press release, the words &#147;could&#148;, &#147;should&#148;, &#147;will&#148;, &#147;play&#148;, &#147;believe&#148;, &#147;anticipate&#148;, &#147;intend&#148;,
&#147;estimate&#148;, &#147;expect&#148;, &#147;project&#148; and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements
are based on Alta Mesa&#146;s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. Forward-looking statements may include statements about Alta
Mesa&#146;s: business strategy; reserves quantities and the present value of its reserves; financial strategy, liquidity and capital required for its development program; future realized oil and natural gas prices; timing and amount of future
production of oil and natural gas; hedging strategy and results; future drilling plans; marketing of oil and natural gas; leasehold or business acquisitions; costs of developing its properties; liquidity and access to capital; uncertainty regarding
its future operating results; and plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this press release that are not historical. Alta Mesa cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties,
most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond its control, incident to the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, low
prices for oil and/or natural gas, global economic conditions, inflation, increased operating cost, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services, environmental risks, weather risk, drilling and other operating risks,
regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures, and other risks. Reserve engineering is a
process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost
assumptions made by reservoir engineers. Specifically, future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. Prices for oil or gas began a severe decline
in the third quarter of 2014 and remain depressed as of the date of this press release. Sustained lower prices will cause the twelve month weighted average price to decrease over time as the lower prices are reflected in the average price, which may
result in the estimated quantities and present values of Alta Mesa&#146;s reserves being reduced. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant,
such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Should one or more of the
risks or uncertainties described in this press release occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, Alta Mesa&#146;s actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. All
forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or
oral forward-looking statements that we may issue. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events
or circumstances after the date of this press release. </P>

in Karnes County, Texas.&nbsp;The effective date of the transaction was July&nbsp;1, 2015. The Sale disposed of all of the Company&#146;s remaining interests in this area. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the aggregate cash purchase price for all the Membership Interest was $125 million subject to certain adjustments, consisting
of $118 million (the &#147;Base Purchase Price&#148;), and additional contingent payments of approximately $7.0 million in the aggregate,&nbsp;payable to the Company by EnerVest by the 15th of each calendar month in which&nbsp;certain amounts owed
to AME prior to the effective date have been received. The net cash Base Purchase Price, after payment of transaction-related fees and expenses, was approximately $116.2 million. On October&nbsp;1, 2015, total cash paid to the Company was $85.2
million, consisting of $82.6 million equal to 70% of the Base Purchase Price, and $2.6 million for customary closing adjustments. Of the remaining Base Purchase Price, (a)&nbsp;20% will be paid to the Company on the earlier of
(i)&nbsp;November&nbsp;2, 2015 (&#147;Second Funding Date&#148;) or (ii)&nbsp;three business days after EnerVest obtains the required proceeds under a credit facility secured by AME&#146;s assets; and (b)&nbsp;10%, less amounts for (i)&nbsp;any
agreed upon uncured title defects, within three business days of November&nbsp;2, 2015 and (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any disputed title defects, on a date after an independent expert&#146;s final and binding decision. The Sale Agreement provides for
customary adjustments to the Base Purchase Price for revenues and expenses incurred after the Effective Date. On November&nbsp;2, 2015, the Company received $35.4 million, which represents the remainder of our sales proceeds. Cash received, after
transactions-related fees and expenses, was utilized to pay down borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
