shall mean any direct or indirect instance of (a) the development, marketing or selling of, or assisting others to develop, market
or sell, research and/or advisory services in the areas of information technology, supply chain management, and/or digital marketing,
regardless of the manner in which such research and/or advisory services are provided, or (b) the solicitation, directly or indirectly,
of the Company&rsquo;s clients or known prospects for the purposes of developing, digital marketing or selling the products or

independent business venturer, partner, member, employee or otherwise). &ldquo;<B>Non-Compete Area</B>&rdquo; shall mean any jurisdiction
or location in which the Company conducts business or has clients or prospects, including Europe, North America, the USA, the United
Kingdom, Australia, Asia, Asia-Pacific &amp; Japan, Middle East, Central and South America, or Africa. &ldquo;<B>Restraint Period</B>&rdquo;
shall mean the period of three (3) years following the last date on which any SARs vest. During the Restraint Period, the Grantee

consultant, analyst, sales person, independent contractor, agent, independent business venturer, partner or member). The Grantee
agrees that the restrictions in this Paragraph 17 will apply as if they consisted of several separate, independent and cumulative
covenants and restraints. Employee further agrees that if any separate covenant and restraint described in this Paragraph 17 is
unenforceable, illegal or void, that covenant and restraint is severed and the other covenants and restraints remain in full force
and effect. It will not be a violation of this Agreement for the Grantee to take an accounting and finance position with an entity
that derives a portion (but less than a majority) of its revenues from Competitive Acts, provided that the Grantee does not engage
in sales, marketing, development, operational or strategic activities related to such Competitive Acts and or the portion of the
New Entity related thereto. It also will not be a violation of this Agreement for the Grantee to take a senior executive position
with an entity (the &ldquo;<B>New Entity</B>&rdquo;) so long the New Entity itself does not engage in any Competitive Act, it being
understood that affiliated corporations of the New Entity may engage in Competitive Acts but only if both the group of affiliated
entities that includes the New Entity derives less than a majority of its revenues from Competitive Acts and the Grantee does not
engage in any sales, marketing, development, operational or strategic activities related to such Competitive Acts. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, during the final eighteen (18) months of the Restraint Period, only the following entities and their successors
will be deemed to be engaged in Competitive Acts: Forrester, CEB Towergroup, IDG (inclusive of IDC), Informa (inclusive of Ovum

that the Company may modify the foregoing list of entities considered to be engaging in Competitive Acts at any time upon at least
thirty (30) days&rsquo; written notice to the Grantee.</P>

of Section&nbsp;409A, the payment of such accelerated PSUs nevertheless shall be made at the same time or times as if such PSUs
had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant (whether or not the Grantee remains in Continued

will be paid to the Grantee&rsquo;s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death, subject to Paragraph&nbsp;9. Thereafter,

Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;<B>Section&nbsp;409A</B>&rdquo; means Section&nbsp;409A of the U.S.

Company may establish from time to time. Among other things, Grantee must acknowledge and agree that (a) for U.S. income tax purposes,
all taxable income from the Performance Stock Units will be reported to Grantee alone, (b) if Grantee proposes to change the nature
or character of the transferee trust, Grantee first must inform the Company and the Company may require that the Performance Stock
Units be transferred back to Grantee alone, and (c) no additional other or further transfers of the Performance Stock Units will

agrees that, during the Restraint Period (as defined below), for any reason, the Grantee will not engage in any Competitive Act
within the Non-Compete Area. For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;<B>Competitive Act</B>&rdquo; (independently and collectively)
shall mean any direct or indirect instance of (a) the development, marketing or selling of, or assisting others to develop, market
or sell, research and/or advisory services in the areas of information technology, supply chain management, and/or digital marketing,
regardless of the manner in which such research and/or advisory services are provided, or (b) the solicitation, directly or indirectly,
of the Company&rsquo;s clients or known prospects for the purposes of developing, digital marketing or selling the products or
services referred to in clause (a), by the Grantee (whether as a consultant, analyst, sales person, independent contractor, agent,
independent business venturer, partner, member, employee or otherwise). &ldquo;<B>Non-Compete Area</B>&rdquo; shall mean any jurisdiction
or location in which the Company conducts business or has clients or prospects, including Europe, North America, the USA, the United
Kingdom, Australia, Asia, Asia-Pacific &amp; Japan, Middle East, Central and South America, or Africa. &ldquo;<B>Restraint Period</B>&rdquo;
shall mean the period of three (3) years following the last date on which any PSUs vest. During the Restraint Period, the Grantee
will notify (in writing and not less than 72 hours in advance) the Company&rsquo;s General Counsel if he or she intends to become
an employee or other service provider of any entity other than the Company (for example, but not by way of limitation, as an employee,
consultant, analyst, sales person, independent contractor, agent, independent business venturer, partner or member). The Grantee
agrees that the restrictions in this Paragraph&nbsp;14 will apply as if they consisted of several separate, independent and cumulative
covenants and restraints. Employee further agrees that if any separate covenant and restraint described in this Paragraph&nbsp;14
is unenforceable, illegal or void, that covenant and restraint is severed and the other covenants and restraints remain in full
force and effect. It will not be a violation of this Agreement for the Grantee to take an accounting and finance position with
an entity that derives a portion (but less than a majority) of its revenues from Competitive Acts, provided that the Grantee does
not engage in sales, marketing, development, operational or strategic activities related to such Competitive Acts and or the portion
of the New Entity related thereto. It also will not be a violation of this Agreement for the Grantee to take a senior executive
position with an entity (the &ldquo;<B>New Entity</B>&rdquo;) so long the New Entity itself does not engage in any Competitive
Act, it being understood that affiliated corporations of the New Entity may engage in Competitive Acts but only if both the group
of affiliated entities that includes the New Entity derives less than a majority of its revenues from Competitive Acts and the
Grantee does not engage in any sales, marketing, development, operational or strategic activities related to such Competitive Acts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the final eighteen (18) months of the Restraint Period, only the following entities and their
successors will be deemed to be engaged in Competitive Acts: Forrester, CEB Towergroup, IDG (inclusive of IDC), Informa (inclusive
of Ovum and Datamonitor), The Advisory Board Company (ABCO), IHS, Info-Tech Research, ISG (Information Services Group), The 451
Group (inclusive of Yankee, Uptime Research, etc.), and SCM World (Supply Chain), eMarketer, Sirius Decisions, G2Crowd, and TrustRadius;
provided, however, that the Company may modify the foregoing list of entities considered to be engaging in Competitive Acts at
any time upon at least thirty (30) days&rsquo; written notice to the Grantee.</P>
