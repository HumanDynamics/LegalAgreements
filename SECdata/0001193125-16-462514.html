<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February 10, 2016, FBR &amp; Co. (the &#147;Company&#148;) granted awards under a retention and incentive arrangement approved by the Board of Directors
that is designed to further the long-term growth of the Company by providing long-term incentives in respect of the Company&#146;s common stock and other equity interests and assets related to the business of the Company and to assist the Company in
retaining key employees of experience and ability (the &#147;Retention Program&#148;). Richard J. Hendrix, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Bradley J. Wright, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and the other Named
Executive Officers will participate in the Retention Program, along with 44 other key employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An award under the Retention Program represents an
interest in the Award Pool established under the Retention Program. The Award Pool consists of a fixed number of shares of Company restricted common stock units (&#147;RSU Pool&#148;) drawn from the shares available under the Company&#146;s 2006
Long-Term Incentive Program (&#147;Stock Plan&#148;) and a specified pool of securities (and the proceeds of those securities and any replacement securities) (&#147;Asset Pool&#148;), which will be issued, held or paid by the Company for the benefit
of the participants in the Retention Program. Each participant in the Retention Program has been allocated an interest in the aggregate Award Pool. Because the number of Participants is fixed at the outset of the Retention Program, and the aggregate
Award Pool is likewise fixed, any forfeiture of awards by participants who cease to be employed by the Company will result in the remaining Participants being entitled to a proportionately larger share of the Award Pool assuming that they remain
employed through the vesting date or as otherwise specified in the Retention Program. The aggregate number of RSUs subject to the Retention Program is 167,426, and the fair market value of the Asset Pool as of February&nbsp;10, 2016, was
approximately $2,765,938. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Retention Program, and subject to accelerated vesting in certain limited circumstances, awards will vest if the
employee participant remains employed by the Company as of the fourth anniversary following the date of the award. In general, the Company will (1) satisfy the obligations in respect of an Asset Pool award by paying cash and/or delivering assets
from the Asset Pool with an aggregate &#147;fair market value&#148; (as defined in the Retention Program) equal to the portion of the Asset Pool in respect of each Asset Pool award, and (2) issue shares of Company common stock (or, in the discretion
of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, a cash payment based on the per share &#147;fair market value&#148; (as defined in the Stock Plan)) in settlement of the vested RSU Pool awards. The foregoing description of the Retention
Program is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Retention Program and to the related award letter and restricted stock unit agreement filed as Exhibits hereto, and to the Stock Plan, which has been previously filed by the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Retention Program, awards to the Named Executive Officers were as follows: (1) Richard J. Hendrix, the Company&#146;s Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer received an award valued at approximately $250 thousand, including an RSU grant from the RSU Pool valued at approximately $125 thousand and an award of the Asset Pool valued at approximately $125 thousand; (2) Bradley J. Wright,
the Company&#146;s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, received an award valued at approximately $250 thousand, including an RSU grant from the RSU Pool valued at approximately $125 thousand and an award of the Asset Pool valued at

annual revenue that may be paid out under the qualified performance-based awards to any individual participant, and the maximum percentage of annual revenue that may be paid out under the awards to all of the participants as a group. The amounts

required by law. The chairman of the meeting shall have the authority to make such rules and regulations, to establish such procedures and to take such steps as he may deem necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of each meeting of the

irrevocable appointment is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he did not know of its existence when he acquired the
shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares. Subject to any legal limitations on the right of the Corporation to accept the vote or other action of a proxy and to any
express limitation on the proxy&#146;s authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled to accept the proxy&#146;s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment. Any fiduciary who is

shares held by each. This list shall be arranged by voting group and within each voting group by class or series of shares. For a period of ten (10)&nbsp;days prior to the meeting, such list shall be kept on file at the registered office of the
Corporation or at its principal office or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and
place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting for the purpose thereof. The original share transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to which shareholders are entitled to
examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders. The right of a shareholder to inspect such list prior to the meeting shall be subject to the conditions and limitations set forth by law. If the requirements of this
<U>Section</U><U>&nbsp;</U><U>1.10</U> have not been substantially complied with, the meeting shall, on the demand of any shareholder in person or by proxy, be adjourned until such requirements are met. Refusal or failure to prepare or make
available the shareholders&#146; list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting prior to the making of any such demand, but any action taken by the shareholders after the making of any such demand shall be invalid and of no effect.

Until vesting occurs and your Award is settled, you will not have any ownership rights in the value or assets underlying your Asset Pool Award or the shares of Common Stock underlying your RSU Pool Award. Upon the settlement of any individual Award
prior to the time that all Awards vest (<I>e.g.</I>, as a result of the death of a Participant), the Award Pool shall be reduced by the amount paid or delivered in respect of such settlement, and the Award Units settled shall be retired and shall

full ownership of your units of the Company common stock.<B> </B>This RSU Award will have a restriction period that will lapse on February 10, 2020, subject to your continued employment with the Company through such date.&nbsp;Section 7(a) of the
Plan sets forth your rights to accelerated vesting of all or a pro-rata portion of your RSU Award in the event of certain terminations of employment prior to February 10, 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Settlement of Units</B>: As soon as practicable (and in any event within 55 days) after the restriction period lapses (but no later than
March 15 of the year following the year in which the RSUs vest) and after satisfaction of your tax obligation (as described in the &#147;Taxes&#148; section below), the Company will issue shares of its common stock to you (or, in the
Committee&#146;s discretion, a cash payment based on the per share &#147;fair market value&#148; (as defined in the Stock Plan) will be paid to you) in settlement of the vested RSUs and you will have full ownership rights in those shares. The number
of shares that will be issued will equal the number of RSUs that vest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Dividend Equivalents</B>: If FBR chooses to pay a dividend in
the future, you will be entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to any cash, stock or other property dividends that are paid on shares of the Company&#146;s common stock during the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the earlier of
(a) the date that you vest in the RSUs or (b) the date that you forfeit the RSUs. Your right to receive these dividend equivalents, if any, is subject to the same vesting requirements that apply to the RSUs. Any dividends that are payable to you
will be paid at the same time that shares of Company common stock are issued (or, in the Committee&#146;s discretion, cash is paid) in settlement of your RSUs. Such payments will be treated as compensation reportable on your Form W-2 (rather than as
dividend income). </P>

purposes.&nbsp;Generally, in the U.S., you will not be taxed at the time of the grant.&nbsp;However, upon settlement of the RSU Award, the value of the Company common stock and any cash or other property issued or paid to you is taxed as ordinary
income and you are required to pay taxes at that time.&nbsp;The shares will not be released until payment for the taxes is received.&nbsp;FBR will provide you with instructions for making payments closer to your vesting date. </P>
