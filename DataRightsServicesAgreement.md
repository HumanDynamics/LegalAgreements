STANDARD DATA RIGHTS 
DISTRIBUTED MANAGEMENT 
SERVICES AGREEMENT

BETWEEN

DATA RIGHTS OWNER

AND

DATA [USER][HANDLER] 



[REVIEW NOTE: Capitalized, bracketed terms are defined in Schedule 2.]

This Standard Data Rights Distributed  Management Services  Agreement ("Agreement") is effective as to any [Party]  on the date of [Acceptance]  of the [Online Registration]  of any such Party (the “Effective Date”)(such party a “Registered Party”).  

Registered Party Rights and Obligations: From and after the Effective Date, and until the [Termination Date], any Registered Party in [Good Standing] under this Agreement shall enjoy the rights of a “Data Rights Owner,” and be subject to the obligations and affirmative duties of a “Data User” as the context requires, all as provided herein.  

[DRAFTING NOTE:  Consider moving following narrative paragraphs out of the body of the Agreement to the endnotes, or editing the narrative for use with individual-facing version of Agreement and educational materials].  

Hence, each Registered Party hereunder will have the status of a “Data Rights Owner” and “Data User” under this Agreement, but its rights and duties recognized under this Agreement will vary, as required, from those associated with one or the other status depending upon their roles in a particular [Data Action Event.].   References to “Data Rights Owner” and “Data User” hereunder are intended to convey such status differences as the context requires, and both terms are used alternately with references to “Registered Party” as the context requires.

Registered Party in Its Role as Data Rights Owner Enjoys Distributed Data Rights Management Services:  The satisfactory performance by Registered Parties of their various duties under this Agreement in their capacity as Data Users, and their accountability therefor through mechanisms of enforcement under this Agreement (or cross referenced in the schedules hereof), [makes real][gives effect to] the rights of Data Rights Owners under this Agreement, and carries into effect the system of distributed Data Rights Management “Services” (including the sub-categories  of Services set forth in Section 3 hereof).  

These Services are, in turn, enjoyed by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners in consideration of their provisional and conditional granting of various specific data rights under this Agreement to other Registered Parties acting as Data Users hereunder in order to secure such satisfactory performance.  

The rights and duties hereunder are mutually dependent and are enforceable pursuant to this standard form contract, and each Registered Party is therefore [expected][understood] to assume alternating roles under this Agreement.   This Agreement documents an integrated and distributed network of dependencies in which it is in every Registered Party’s self interest to perform the duties under the Agreement (in its capacity as both a Data User, and also those duties assigned to Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners) as an integrated legal structure designed to help auto-catalyze otherwise-unattainable security and leverage benefits for Registered Parties acting both as Data Rights Owners and as Data Users under this Agreement.   

Registered Party in the Role of Data User Enjoys Data Access, Cost Reduction and Risk/Liability Mitigation:  Not only does the satisfactory performance by a Registered Party of its various duties under this Agreement in its role as Data User qualify such Registered User for the protection of their rights as a Data Rights Owner hereunder; it also qualifies such Data User for the rights and benefits provided to Data Users under this Agreement.  

Data User rights include, without limitation, (i) enhanced, co-managed access to higher quality  Circulating Data and Vault Data under the terms hereof, (ii) various contractual “safe harbors” described herein, (iii) the benefits of conditional covenants by Registered Parties not to sue other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Users with respect to objectively-testable, Agreement-conformant behavior, and (iv) other standards that can help to reduce the risk and cost to Data Users of interacting with data, and enhance access to valuable Circulating and Vault Data for Registered Parties as Data Users (consistent with and in furtherance of Data Rights Owners enforceable interests), all as provided further in this Agreement.

Registered Parties are All Mutually Bound:  Upon Registration Acceptance (which follows the act of Registration for Registered Party [Applications] that meet [Acceptance Criteria], which includes an affirmative agreement to the terms of this Agreement) each Registered Party is bound to all other Registered Parties to this Agreement, and hence into direct contractual “privity” with every other Registered Party.  There are no third party beneficiary rights under the Agreement, which means that only Registered Parties can enjoy the contract rights under this Agreement, and only Registered Parties are bound to its terms.   

To enjoy such rights, a party must agree to be bound to the duties of a Data User [and also the duties of a Data Rights Owner] hereunder, knowing that any and all Registered Parties in the entire population of Registered Parties can enforce this Agreement against any other Registered Party, including them, under the terms of this Agreement and as otherwise provided by applicable law.   

Thus, when a party becomes a Registered Party, it owes duties under this Agreement to take actions relating to Vault Data and Circulating Data pursuant to described duties-of-care which conform to the obligations and responsibilities of a “Data User” hereunder, and they simultaneously become a beneficiary of the conformant performance by other Registered Parties to those standards-of-care.   The conformant performance of such duties gives life to the legal rights of Data Rights Owner hereunder.   [The use of a standard form agreement (such as this Agreement) across the entire population of Registered Parties assures that the rights and duties will extend to both bind and benefit all other Registered Parties, even those that a particular Registered Party will never meet in person.

In the distributed legal architecture of this Agreement, the standardized, auditable, accountable, enforceable rights and duties connect each Registered Party to every other Registered Party, and create behavioral reliability that is the precursor to formalized, scalable  “trust” among all Registered Parties and every other Registered Party.   The system’s reliability is built upon the distributed sources of a form of “neighborhood watch” constructed from the natural attentiveness of the stakeholders (borne of self-interest) regarding their respective rights under this Agreement (whether such rights are characterized as related to fundamental, civil, contractual, statutory, regulatory, or other rights in a given jurisdiction) and their ability to exercise private rights of action under this Agreement to enforce those rights.   

Supplemental Rights Permitted: The various rights that are fostered by this Agreement, and are manifested in the Services under section 3, are each intended to deliver real benefit to realize the Data Rights Owners’ interests in the two general categories of “data security/privacy” and “data leverage.”   The performance of the bundle of Data User duties by Registered Parties under this Agreement in their respective capacities as Data Users is enjoyed by Data Rights Owners as distributed  Data Rights Management Services.  

All Registered Parties will be equally bound to the obligations and duties set forth in this Agreement, provided that any sub-group of Registered Owners may agree to additional rights and duties that apply only to such sub-group, so long as they are not inconsistent with [(and promote)] those provided under this Agreement.   

Thus, for example, commercial, governmental or civil society entities that institutionalize the provision of some or all of such “Supplemental Services” hereunder in their role as [Data User Intermediaries], may offer various additional incentives, such as monetary payments and service enhancements, to attract Registered Parties to a particular set of Supplemental Services.  In such a case, both Registered Parties will be aware that such Supplemental Services are required to be provided in a manner that is consistent with the Services hereunder, which Services are more broadly recognized beyond any such sub-group of Registered Parties to which such Supplemental Services apply, and which Services reflect the population-cohering behavioral artifact of a basic distributed legal infrastructure, documented in this Agreement, to support the distributed data architecture of the Internet.

[DRAFTING NOTE:  End of narrative paragraphs to consider moving to notes]

For and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Registered Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby contract and agree as follows :

1. Background and Purpose;  Agreement Standardizes a Set of Data Usage Duties and Supplements Other Agreements.

[DRAFTING NOTE:  Consider moving the following narrative paragraphs to the notes.]

This Agreement documents a set of mutually-dependent agreements associated with data-related exchanges and interactions between and among multiple Registered Parties, including both individuals and institutions,  each of which is called a “Registered Party” and each of which alternately acts as a "Data Rights Owner" and ["Data User"][“Data Handler”] (both as defined below), sometimes in both roles even within a related series of interactions. . 

The “dual role” of every Registered Party provides the incentive, balanced with obligation, that is a stabilizing influence in this data infrastructure for other economic/legal/social architectures upon which co-managed data rights management depends.  Under this Agreement structure, to reduce one’s own risk, a Registered Party must act in a way to help other Registered Parties to reduce their respective risks.  The opportunity of a Party to enjoy the rights provided under this Agreement is conditioned upon their performance of duties under this Agreement.   The interdependence of these contractual rights and duties in this document is intended to reflect and make reliable and enforceable their functional mutual interdependence so that data system reliability can be established as a foundation for online “trust.”   

The Agreement structure seeks to create and deploy a distributed legal architecture to serve the needs of stakeholders engaging in data exchanges across data networks that depend upon a distributed data architecture, such as the Internet.  Accordingly, under this Agreement, each Registered Party in its role as Data User shall, in consideration for enjoying its rights as Data User as set forth herein, abide by certain conditions and requirements associated with its access to such data (“Data User Duties”).  

Every Registered Party’s’ fulfillment of its promise to perform the duties assigned to it under this Agreement  constitutes the successful “recruitment” of Registered Parties as Data Users to help achieve Registered Party’s goals to enjoy rights (such as “privacy” and other data integrity rights) as Data Rights Owners.  The performance of these standard duties by populations of Registered Parties/Data Users achieves risk and cost reduction at large scale for all Registered Parties, in ways that they cannot achieve unilaterally (and cannot even achieve among existing online data/identity standards consortia), and more effectively provides Data Rights Owner and Data Rights Owner's Affiliates (if that option is selected by Data Rights Owner) with functional, enforceable, accountable, “crowd sourced,” data rights management services (and related identity information-technology services) received from any party that comes into possession of Vault Data and Circulating Data in which Data Rights Owner has an interest, all on the terms and conditions set forth below.  

To the extent that either the Data Rights Owner or Data User are, at any time while they are a party to this Agreement,  parties to a separate legal agreement (or other legal obligation) through which Data User collects, stores, handles, uses, transfers, processes [other verbs here to cover standard set of “Data Actions?”] or otherwise has possession or access to data from, relating to or relatable to  Data Rights Owner in accordance with that agreement and applicable local law or pursuant to which data about Data Rights Owner is shared with third-parties (whether such sharing is done on behalf of Data Rights Owner or Data User), as the case may be (each an “Existing Agreement”), the Registered Parties that are also the Parties thereto wish to continue to be bound by such Existing Agreements to define their legal relationships external to those set forth in this Agreement, and to supplement such Existing Agreements with the terms of this Agreement.  The Parties mutually acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement are supplemental to those of the Existing Agreement(s), and to the extent of any conflict between the terms of such agreements, the terms of this Agreement replace and supersede the terms and conditions of the Existing Agreements. 

2.   DEFINITIONS

The words and phrases set forth in Schedule 2 hereof, when used in this Agreement, shall have the indicated meanings.  (Terms capitalized within a particular definition have been defined elsewhere within this Agreement.) 

[REVIEW NOTE:  Schedule 2 is under development.  Various definitions are currently being drafted.  Also, we are in the process of working with various folks at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other institutions to harmonize the language of this legal agreement with terminology that is more familiar to technology-oriented system architects.  The intention is to use these definitional toe-holds in the Agreement make the legal tools for dealing with system user reliability issues more accessible to technology folks, and vice versa.  Until such later time as they are integrated into the Agreement, please ignore those definitions, and the accompanying footnotes, that are highlighted in green, since they are not yet integrated into the text.]

3.   SERVICES

From and after the Effective Date, Registered Party shall perform the duties, and abide by the terms and conditions, applicable to Data Users hereunder (the performance of which is collectively referred to as the “Services” hereunder) to and for the benefit of  all other Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Rights Owners, as the context requires.  

The Services include :

Collection - Data Acquisition and Collection Services (see Section 3.2 and Schedule 3.2), 

Holding - Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services (see Section 3.3 and Schedule 3.3), 

Sharing - Vault Data Sharing Services (including various identity management and attribute-related services, credentialing services, etc.) (see Section 3.4 and Schedule 3.4),

De-Identification and Leverage - Circulating Data Leverage Services (see Section 3.5 and Schedule 3.5), 

Portability - Data Portability Services (see Section 3.6 and Schedule 3.6), and

Data Recovery - Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services (see Section 3.7 and Schedule 3.7).

3.1.  Provision of Services

Commencing on the Effective Date, and at all times thereafter during the Term, except as otherwise expressly stated herein, Data User shall perform all of the Services described in this Section 3  in accordance with the requirements and in conformity with the standards set forth in the relevant subsections of this Section 3, and in the several service schedules of this Section 3.

3.2.  Data Acquisition and Collection Services

During the Term, Data User shall provide Data Acquisition and Collection Services as described in Schedule 3.2 hereto.   [Drafting Note:  Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section]

3.3.  Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services.  

During the Term, Data User shall provide Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services as described in Schedule 3.3 hereto.    [Drafting Note:  Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section]

 	3.4.  Vault Data Sharing Services.   

During the Term, Data User shall provide Vault Data Sharing Services pursuant to the Vault Data Sharing Services [Agency] Agreement set forth in Schedule 3.4 hereto.   

Other than a transfer pursuant to a Data Portability Event described in section __,  in no event will Data User transfer or provide access to any Vault Data to any third party that is not a Registered Party, even upon the request of any one or more Data Rights Owners.   [Drafting Note:  Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section]

3.5 Circulating Data Leverage Services.  

During the Term, Data User shall provide Circulating Data Leverage Services as described in Schedule 3.5 hereto.   

In no event will Data User transfer or provide access to any Circulating Data to any party that is not a Registered Party, even upon the request of any one or more Data Rights Owners of the Vault Data from which such Circulating Data was derived.   

To the extent that Data User satisfies the “safe harbor” elements described in Schedule 3.5 in its processes and protocols for deriving Circulating Data from Vault Data, such Data User will be held harmless from and against any claims of Data Rights Owners associated with the Services described in Schedule 3.5. [Drafting Note:  Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section].

3.6.  Data Portability Services

Following the Effective Date, Data User shall provide Data Portability Services as set forth in Schedule 3.6 hereto.   Such Services shall be available to Data Rights Owner at all times during the term, and upon Termination of the Agreement with or without cause.  

Where such Services are made available in the context of a Termination of the Agreement due to Data User default,  such Services are in addition to, and not in substitution for the payments received and other remedies available under section __ hereof.   [Drafting Note:  Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section].

3.7 Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services

Following the Effective Date, Data User shall provide Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services as set forth in Schedule 3.7 hereto.    

Where these Services are provided in the context of an Unauthorized Access to Vault Data or Vault Meta Data held by Data User, such services are in addition to, and not in substitution for the payments received and other remedies available to Data Rights Owner under section __ hereof.   

Such Services will include, but not be limited to, Data User’s obligation to maintain full and complete records and details of all actions taken with respect to all Vault Data and all Circulating Data, and all granting of access permissions and other information necessary to enable the full and complete accounting of all Vault Data AND Circulating Data use.  

[DRAFTING NOTE:  The following paragraph is an effort to craft a legal description of a persistent data permission architecture that can reliably function for data action accounting, without the necessity of “attaching” metadata to data, which can be burdensome on system resources.  The accounting meta data is external to the core data stream and is like a meter on a valve on a pipe.]  Such records and details will be maintained in a manner that has the effect of virtually, but provably, “attaching” the metadata to all Vault Data used or transferred, not with an actual physical or file based joining of such data and meta data, but rather through the maintenance of a data and information system that permits the persistent, non-destructible maintenance of the metadata information in any manner that permits the verifiably accurate reconstruction of such metadata by the Data Users, the Data Rights Owner and any other party authorized to have access to such data under contract or public law. [Drafting Note:  Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section]

3.8.  Future Services

Following the Effective Date, Registered Party in its capacity as Data User may offer to one or more Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners additional services that are different than the Services described in this Agreement.  Each such additional service shall be provided at such time and in the manner as agreed upon by the parties and documented pursuant to a separate agreement, provided however, that to the extent that any such supplemental arrangement is consistent with (and in furtherance of) the rights and obligations under this Agreement, such supplemental arrangements may be documented by additions and supplements, but not deletions or modifications, to one or more of the Schedules to this Agreement and the acceptance of such terms by the Data Rights Owner from time to time.  

4.   Expected Service Levels (“ESLs”) 

ESLs may be established for one or more of the following categories of services:

Data Acquisition and Collection Services, 
Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services, 
Vault Data Sharing Services
Data Portability Services
Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services
Other Services made available by Data User to Data Rights owner from time to time.

ESLs are not anticipated to be established for Circulating Data Leverage Services, since the Data User activities that are associated with such Services are performed by Data User on its own behalf, not on behalf of a Data Rights Owner (notwithstanding the Data User’s obligation to account to Data Rights Owner for revenues generated through its Circulating Data Leverage Services activities). 

ESLs are established for the express purpose of creating a threshold of performance for some aspect of the relevant Service for which the ESL is provided.  In the event that Data User fails to provide and perform the relevant Service at a level that is equivalent to that called for in a particular ESL, Data Rights Owner can pursue remedies through the Fee Reduction Mechanism provided for in section __ of this Agreement, and other remedies provided for herein.   

ESLs are not intended to provide comprehensive “specifications” for duties-of-care associated with performance of Services by Data Users; this entire Agreement and the Schedules set forth a more comprehensive set of requirements associated with Data User performance hereunder.  

Instead, the ESLs are only intended to identify those Service elements for which (i) performance is sufficiently empirically and objectively measurable, and (ii) for which the damages due to harm is the most directly calculable, that ESL performance failures can lend themselves to contractual liquidated damages structures that can be deployed effectively by automated, scalable dispute resolution systems, such as those that support this Agreement.  

Thus, only a subset of the rights of Data Rights Owners will lend themselves to treatment under the ESL arrangements of this section 4.  It is, however, anticipated that the proportion of Services that lend themselves to ESL treatment will increase over time, as candidate “best practices” for emerging Data User standards of care are shared, and rules and expected Vault Data and Circulating Data behaviors are normalized and harmonized across jurisdictions and sectors.  Any such ESL-market advancement will be documented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

4.1.  Specification of ESLs

All ESL’s shall be performed as specified in the ESL section of the relevant Service schedule for that Service identified in section 3 as amended from time to time. 

4.2.  ESL Measurement and Reporting; Accounting.   Data User shall make available  to Data Rights Owners reports and statistics regarding its performance of the various Services with respect to any Vault Data and Circulating Data for any other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners against the ESLs during each calendar month, by the fifteenth (15th) business day of the following month.

Measurements of system availability that are included in the reports under this Agreement shall exclude (i) scheduled downtime, (ii) delays in the provision of a Service schedule requested by or caused by Data Rights Owner, and (iii) unscheduled downtime to the extent attributable to (x) Force Majeure Events, or (y) the acts or omissions of Data Rights Owner or its employees, agents, third-party contractors, and suppliers. 

4.3.  Adoption of “Best Practices” in ESLs

ESLs shall be modified from time to time  pursuant to the amendment processes applicable to the Agreement, to keep pace with current advances in technology and “best practices” in the relevant industry associated with the portion of the Service under review, and other relevant changes in the environments or circumstances in which the Services are being used and relied upon. Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Users hereunder[, that generate revenue from the use Vault Data and Circulating Data,] shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in their respective sectors, jurisdictions and contexts (and subject to applicable law), to improve their performance of the Services, both in relation to the ESLs and otherwise, throughout the Term, whether through the adoption and use of more efficient technologies, more effective network architectures, better integrated technical and legal interoperability advances, and the like.  

 	4.4.  Limited Suspension of ESLs to Accommodate Data Rights Owner

 If and to the extent that Data User fails to meet a specific ESL as a result of material actions, errors, or omissions of Data Rights Owner, such ESL will be deemed to be suspended for an amount of time as is reasonably necessary for Data User to again achieve conformity to such ESL.  Data User may take such reasonable precautions as it deems necessary to prevent the recurrence of any such event.  

5.   DATA USER RESOURCES

 	5.1.  General

With the exception of those [hardware, software, telecommunications, educational, network, and other] product and service resources for which the Data Rights Owner is explicitly responsible as described in Schedule 5.1, Data User shall be fully and entirely responsible for obtaining and gaining access to all software (including licenses to necessary third party software), hardware, documentation, services, and other resources that it requires to perform the Services, including but not limited to the performance in conformity with the relevant ESLs [and CESLS to which the Data User has committed under this Agreement].   

 	5.2.  Unpermitted Uses of Data User Services  

[To come]

5.3.  Customized Use of Data User Services  

 Data Rights Owner (and groups of Data Rights Owners) may request, and Data User may separately agree to provide customized ESL services (“CESLS”) to accommodate and address particular Data Rights Owners’ needs, all on the terms and conditions separately agreed to by the parties to such CESLS from time to time.  Examples (by way of illustration and not exclusion) of the CESLS that may be requested by the Data Rights Owner are increased and additional requirements relating to any one or more of the Services and any other additional obligation or duty relating to the collection, storage, use, transmission and handling of Vault Data and Shared Vault Data by Data User.  

A Registered Party acting as a Data User shall be required to use in connection with its provision of services under a CESLS, and cause its suppliers to use, the third party services, networks, applications and other functionality offered by such other parties as it agrees to provide to Data Rights Owner pursuant to such CESLS.   

Each Data Rights Owner agrees and acknowledges that CESLSs entered into between a particular Registered Party acting as a Data User and other Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners are only binding on such Data User with respect to the Data Rights Owner(s) that are explicitly covered under each such CESLS, and that such Data User’s duties and obligations under any one or more CESLSs do not establish an “industry practice” or “standard of care” that affects the rights of any such other Data Rights Owners, or the Services provided by any Data User to such Data Rights Owners, or any ESL that is not a CESLS, provided that any Data User may agree to adopt and abide by any CESLS of another Data User (either through normative cross reference, or by inclusion of “mirror” CESLS terms directly in its arrangements with Data Rights Owners with which it interacts.  

Registered Party in its capacity as Data Rights Owner also acknowledges and agrees that Data User may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, choose to offer any part or all of the services under any CESLS to one or more other Data Rights Owners, and others, and may establish new Services that offer such services, except as the Data Rights Owner and such Data User have previously agreed, and that Data Rights Owner shall have no right in any such new services, and shall receive no compensation therefore, except to the extent otherwise explicitly set forth in a CESLS, or other law or agreement applicable to the parties and to a particular CESLS in to which they have entered.

A Data Rights Owner that has entered a CESLS with Data User will reasonably cooperate with Data User in causing any third party services identified by Data Rights Owner to be made interoperable with the Services.  [Subject to the applicable CESLS, Data Rights Owner will reimburse and hold Data User harmless from and against all costs paid by Data User with respect to third party charges incurred on Data Rights Owner's behalf, and at Data Rights Owner’s request, in Data User’s fulfillment of such CESLS.]  

A Data User may use and apply any such third party connection or arrangement that was originally established for one Data Rights Owner to also interoperate with any other Data Rights Owner without the prior written consent of Data Rights Owner, provided however, that it shall provide notice of such use to the Data Rights Owner with which it entered the CESLS covering such connection, and shall reduce or eliminate any future payments required to be paid by such Data Rights Owner to reflect the equitable sharing of such expenses across the group of Data Rights Owners for which the connection or arrangement offers an advantage .

5.4.  Non-Exclusivity

Nothing herein shall prevent (i) The Data User from providing services (including the Services as defined herein) to any Data Rights Owner (or any third party in the case of generic services that are not “Services” under this Agreement, or (ii) the Data Rights Owner from obtaining any type of services (including Services) from any other Party.

6.   Security Obligations

As an integral part of each of the Services provided hereunder, Data User shall be fully and solely responsible to Data Rights Owner for taking reasonable precautions and actions to ensure the security and integrity of Vault Data at a level that is no less than (but may exceed) the standards of care established by __________  or the standards of care that are conformant to the standards set forth in Schedule 6), whichever are greater, applicable to a particular element of each set of standards.  The relevant standards of care that are intended to be applied are those relating to: 

(i) the security, data, and process integrity of the collection, storage, use, combination, processing, compilation, transmission, sharing, disposal, and all other activities in which Data User engages in providing Services with respect to Vault Data, 

(ii) all physical and virtual (e.g., cloud) equipment, storage facilities, and transmission facilities on which or through which Vault Data is stored, processed, compiled, or transmitted, and 

(iii) physical, technical and policy infrastructure intended to prevent and detect Data User employee or independent contractor and third party unauthorized access and use of Vault Data and related fraud, abuse, or other un-agreed uses. 

(iv) [other?]

The security obligations that are imposed on Data User by this section 6 shall not extend to Circulating Data, provided, however, that the Data User shall keep and maintain confidential those non-public elements of its protocols, techniques, and processes used to achieve the de-identification of Vault Data necessary to create Circulating Data, to the extent that the revealing of such processes would enable Data Users of Circulating Data to “reverse engineer” Vault Data from Circulating Data, provided however, that Data User are obligated to be transparent about their de-identification processes to a degree sufficient to be able to demonstrate that they have satisfied the objective tests necessary to qualify for the Circulating Data safe harbor set forth in section ___, and provided further that Data Rights Owner will indemnify and hold Data User harmless from and against any liability for [Transferee Data User] [Re-identification] of Circulating Data that was not the result of [Transferor Data User] negligence in the process of De-identification or Data User failure to keep confidential its De-identification processes. 

Data User violation or default under this section 6 shall be remedied as provided under section ___. 

7.   Data Rights Owner-Retained Authority and Obligations

7.1.  Data Rights Owner Authority

Data Rights Owner shall retain all of its pre-existing intellectual property and proprietary rights [in addition to its fundamental rights that are in no event assignable] in Vault Data relating to such Data Rights Owner that comes into the possession or control or is made accessible to any Registered Party acting as a Data User, or that is transferred to any Data User on their behalf, and all fundamental and other rights, if any, that they have in Vault Data with which Data User interacts that relates to Data Rights Owner.   Data Rights Owner shall also exercise decision-making authority, as provided in this Agreement, with respect to the overall application of the Services with respect to the Vault Data, provided that Data Rights Owner may delegate part of such authority to one or more Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Users, or another Registered Party acting as intermediary, as necessary for it to enjoy the Services, or under one or more CESLS arrangements.  

Data Rights Owner acknowledges and agrees that Data User will apply de-identification processes that are consistent with those processes set forth in relevant portions of the Schedules to any Vault Data to generate Circulating Data, and that such Circulating Data is not subject to this section 7.1 or any of the other provisions of this Agreement applicable to Vault Data.  Under this Agreement, while Data Rights Owner will continue to retain its rights in Vault Data, its rights regarding Circulating Data under this Agreement are limited solely to the receipt of such compensation for the use of such data as is made explicitly available from time to time by Data User under this Agreement,  and any such other rights as are explicitly established for Data Rights Owner hereunder.

7.2.  Access to Data and Cooperation

In acknowledgement of the Parties’ mutual interest in the development and deployment of effective, efficient, reliable and predictable Data User Services, the Parties agree that they will reasonably cooperate with one another in all matters relating to Data Users’ performance of the Services.  Such cooperation shall include (but not be limited to) Data Owner providing Data User with [Reasonable Permitted Access]  to Vault Data as reasonably required by Data User to perform the operational, administrative, technical, and other functions reasonably necessary to provide the Services.

8.   Financial Terms

This Agreement anticipates a variety of sub-types of Services (as set forth in Section 3) each of which has different values and economics for different Registered Parties, and the Schedules for each of which sets forth a structure of payment terms to reflect and support those economics.  

The Agreement anticipates that payments may be owed between and among various Registered Parties in their capacities as both Data Rights Owners and Data Users, and that such payments may be made both from Data User to Data Rights Owner and from Data Rights Owner to Data User, depending on the circumstances as further described below.  

In an effort to reduce administration and operation expenses associated with performance under this Agreement, where such payment obligations arise between Registered Parties, it is anticipated that such payments will be “netted” against one another, with the overall intention being that, except in the unusual circumstance, Data Rights Owners will not typically be required to pay “out of pocket” for Services.   

The accounting obligations of Data Users under this Agreement support these payment systems, and make possible the netting processes that are set forth in relevant Schedules to this Agreement.

8.1 Fees for Data Acquisition and Collection Services, 

Data Acquisition and Collection Services are provided to Data Rights Owners without charge by Data User.  

8.2  Fees for Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services, 

8.2 (a) Nature of Services: See description of services in section 3.____.

8.2 (b) Fees:  Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services are provided for a fee that is equal to the average daily “cloud-based storage index” that is calculated in the manner set forth in Schedule 8.2.  

8.3  Commissions for Vault Data Sharing Services

8.3 (a) Nature of Services:  As provided in section 3, Data Users may not share Vault Data with any third party without Data Rights Owner’s permission.  That permission may be granted by Data Rights Owners: (i) on a per-sharing-event basis, (ii) by reference to categories of data, (iii) by identification of limited sets of permitted Observer Users, or (iv) any other method agreed upon by the Data User and the Data Rights Owner from time to time under this Agreement that reflects, carries forward and helps make viable Data Rights Owner co-management of Vault Data under this Agreement.  

Data Users may only share Vault Data in a manner that reflects and carries into effect the rights of Data Rights Owner, [acting in a capacity as a data version of a “data agent” pursuant to the Agency Terms set forth under section 3.___] with respect to any such third party use.  In all sharing activities involving Vault Data, and in recognition of Data Rights Owner’s primacy in determining the use and disposition of Vault Data, the Data User will act in a way that is consistent with the interests of Data Rights Owner under this Agreement and is in the best interests of the Data Rights Owner when engaging in any Vault Data Sharing Services.

8.3 (b) Fees:  Data User[, acting in capacity as agent for Data Rights Owner pursuant to the Agency Terms set forth under section 3.____,] shall generate and earn a “Shared Vault Data Commission” from providing Vault Data Sharing Services.  The commission shall be calculated in the manner provided in Schedule 8.3 (b).

8.4 Payments for Circulating Data Leverage  

8.4 (a) Nature of Services: A Registered Party acting in its capacity as a Data User may share, transfer, license, exploit, monetize and otherwise use Circulating Data (collectively “Circulating Data Actions”) freely and without any Data Rights Owner’s permission or consent.  Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Rights Owners acknowledges and agree that, because Circulating Data is de-identified data, (i) no direct interests of Data Rights Owner in Vault Data are per se negatively affected solely by such Circulating Data Actions, including but not limited to interests in the nature of those protected by misappropriation and other similar equitable “unjust enrichment” concepts, and (ii) there is no risk of direct identity intrusion harm solely as a result of the making available of or sharing with third parties of such Circulating Data.   

Notwithstanding the acknowledgement in the prior sentence, Registered Parties also recognize that the Data Rights Owner is a source of Circulating Data (alone or in combination with other Data Rights Owners from which Vault Data is made available to Data User).  

Thus, while the Data User may use and transfer Circulating Data in its discretion, it must also account to and compensate the Data Rights Owner for a portion of the value realized by Data User attributable to the Vault Data of each Data Rights Owner from which the Circulating Data was derived.  This payment is roughly analogous to that made by an oil refining company to a drilling company (or the owner of a well, etc.) for unrefined crude oil, except that payment obligation of a Data User arises, not upon the creation of such Circulating Data, but upon its subsequent use for monetary value.  The Vault Data that is made available by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners is the “feedstock” of the data leverage (multiple users) in the Circulating Data markets.   This Agreement is intended to provide a mechanism for Registered Parties to more explicitly experience the benefits and burdens associated with Circulating Data markets, and to participate, through the choices they make in interacting with other Registered Parties as Data Users, in their co-management and design, development and deployment.

The parties also recognize that de-identified data can be brought together with other data, or can be applied in contexts (or by Registered Parties with subjective prior knowledge) where it can become “personal information” (and therefore once-again classify as “Vault Data” under this Agreement) that can “inform” one or more parties about a Registered Party or other party, as a result of which such data becomes “re-identified data” (and therefore “Vault Data”).  If and to the extent that any such re-identification event results in the creation of Vault Data, any Registered Party that comes into contact with such Vault Data, whether or not be intention or design, shall have the rights and obligations of a Data User with respect to such Vault Data, which results in the Data Rights Owner automatically receiving “Vault Data” Service levels of duty of care, automatically upon such re-identification event, without the requirement of further action by Data Rights Owner, all as dealt with elsewhere in this Agreement.

8.4 (b) Fees:  Data Users shall pay to (or credit against the charges imposed on) Data Rights Owner a periodic fee calculated in the manner set forth in Schedule 8.4(b) in recognition of the portion of revenue generated from the data leverage of Circulating Data originated and derived from Vault Data received from [or about] Data Rights Owner, less allocable direct and indirect costs of providing the Service, and less Data User profit (the “Circulating Data Origination Fee”). 

8.5 Fees for Data Portability Services

		8.5 (a) Nature of Services:  See section 3.___for a description of the Data Portability Services provided by Data User hereunder.

		8.5 (b) Fees:  Data User shall not charge any fee to Data Rights Owner for any Data Portability Services

8.6 Fees for Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services

		8.6 (a) Nature of Services:  See section 3.___for a description of the Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services provided by Data User hereunder.

		8.6 (b) Fees:  Data User shall not charge any fee to Data Rights Owner for any Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services.  

Data User may be required under this Agreement to pay or credit a Fee Reduction to Data Rights Owners with respect to incidents of Unauthorized Access Recovery that also constitute a breach of this Agreement or one or more ESLs or CESLS. 
 
8.7 Shared Savings - Other Costs

As part of the Services provided by it hereunder, Data User will use commercial best efforts to continue to increase the efficiency of the systems through which the Service is provided and to reduce the costs of such services, all without reduction in the quality or availability of its Services or violation of the terms of this Agreement and any ESL or CESL. 

8.8 Third-Party Service Costs

Data Rights Owner will bear costs associated with the provision of services by third parties (other than __________)  that are incurred by Data User on behalf of Data Rights Owner at Data Owner’s Request.  

Any such costs will be invoiced by Data User to Data Rights Owner, and shall be payable by Data Rights Owner without any increases, surcharges, service fees, or other additions added as line items to a Data Rights Owner invoice, provided however, that the Data User may recover its operational, administrative and other costs associated with administering such Services through the mechanism of including such costs in the overall overhead costs that are included in its fee calculations for the Services.

 	8.5.  Accounting and Audit 

8.5 (a)  Data User shall, at such times and in such form as is indicated in Schedule 8.5(a) hereto, make available online to Data Rights Owner a full accounting of all relevant portions of Data User's books and records relating to the Services provided by such Data User to such Data Rights Owner, sufficient to enable the Data Rights Owner to reasonably verify the calculations provided for in this Section 8.  Data User shall provide reasonable access to such information relating to this Agreement and Data User's business as may be necessary to confirm the accuracy of the fees, Fee Reductions, Fee Offsets and other payment and pricing adjustment computations for any given year.  

8.5 (b) Any overcharges, undercharges, or errors in computation discovered by a Data Rights Owner and reported to the Data User that are verified by the Data User shall be reflected as compensating adjustments on the next statement issued by Data User following the date of the completion of such verification.  

8.5 (c) Where Data Rights Owner discovers any net overcharges in excess of five percent (5%) of the amount that should have been payable by Data Rights Owner hereunder, Data User shall, upon request (i) reimburse Data Rights Owner for all costs associated with such review of the accounting; (ii) refund or credit Data Rights Owner (at Data Rights Owner's option) the full amount of such overcharges; and, (iii) pay Data Rights Owner interest on the amount payable under (i) and (ii) at a rate equal to two (2) percentage points above the "prime rate" as published from time to time by The Wall Street Journal.  

8.6. Taxes 

 	8.6 (a) Data Rights Owner shall pay any applicable taxes that may be levied on it and based upon the Services provided by Data User hereunder, including sales, use, value-added, excise, and similar taxes, but excluding taxes levied or imposed upon or with reference to the net income, business privileges or property ownership of Data User, (such taxes collectively, referred to as “Data Rights Owner Taxes”).

	8.6 (b) To the extent Data User is required under applicable law to collect and remit any Data Rights Owner Tax to the relevant taxing authority, Data User shall invoice Data Rights Owner the amount of such tax, as a separate line item, and Data Rights Owner will pay such tax as part of such invoice.

8.6 (c)  Data Rights Owner shall have the right, in its sole discretion and at its cost, to contest the validity of the imposition of any Data Rights Owner Tax. Data User agrees to reasonably cooperate with Data Rights Owner in all such contests, and to reasonably cooperate to facilitate the coordination among Data Rights Owners in any such contest, at their request and cost. 

In no event shall Data User be required to pay any Data Rights Owner Tax that is has not collected from Data Rights Owner, and Data Rights Owner shall hold Data User harmless against and remit to Data User an amount equal to any such actual payment made by Data User to the relevant taxing authority, as well as the amount of any fees, penalties or late charges related thereto, as a result of any determination in connection with any contest with taxing authorities. Data Rights Owner shall not be responsible for any tax penalties, interest or other charges assessed due to Data User's negligence.  

8.7. Services Benchmarking

 As part of the Services, Registered Parties acting as Data Users shall organize and operate a program to enable comparison of its Services to those of other similar Data Users offering [similar services][Services under the same form of Agreement and the same Agreement Schedules] (the “Benchmarking Program”).  The Benchmarking Program will be designed, developed and deployed in a manner that can best enable Data Rights Owners to compare Service quality, fees structures, and data leverage monetization results for both Vault Data and Circulating Data across different offerings of Data User services. 

8.8. Fee Reductions 

This Section 8.8 (and Schedule 8.8) specify certain "Fee Reductions."  It is understood that these Fee Reductions are intended to reflect, to some extent, the diminished value of Data User's Services in certain limited and identified events where system performance does not conform to a relevant ESL.  Fee Reductions are intended to incentivize consistent performance by Registered Parties acting as Data Users and to provide an efficient and satisfactory method of compensatory recovery for Data Rights Owners that experience the subset of system performance issues of the types set forth in Schedule __ from time to time.  

Fee Reductions are not, however, intended to be the sole method through which a Data Rights Owner can seek compensation for any breach or default by Data User under this Agreement, and such other remedies can also be pursued, provided that any Fee Reduction applied to benefit a Data Rights Owner under this Agreement shall reduce the amount of any damages or other payments subsequently received from Data User to compensate Data Rights Owner for the same incident that led to a Material Default.  Fee Reductions are not intended to be liquidated damages, penalties or similar charges.  

Fee Reductions will not be imposed in the event the ESL System performance issue is attributable primarily to: (i) an act or omission of Data Rights Owner; (ii) a Force Majeure event; or (iii) changes in technology equipment or architectures that are implemented by Data Rights Owner without the prior approval of Data User.   

	8.9 Payment Netting and Fee Offsets 

8.10.  Exclusive Payments; Responsibility for Costs

The fees set forth in this Section 8 are the only payments to be made by any Registered Party to another under this Agreement. Except as explicitly provided for in this Agreement, a Registered Party acting as a Data User shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Data Rights Owner harmless against, all costs and expenses incurred by Data User that are necessary to meet Data User's obligations arising under this Agreement

8.11.  Invoices

[Commercial and other institutional] Registered Parties acting in the capacity as Data Users shall make available, or shall cause to make available,  to Data Rights Owners, updated at least monthly, a statement, invoice and report of Circulating Data revenue generation (the “Invoice and Data Leverage Report”) substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 8.11, setting forth in detail all net charges, if any, payable by Data Rights Owner.  Data Rights Owner shall pay the net charge, if any, reflected on each online monthly invoice no later than thirty (30) business days after receipt.

8.12.  Reports

All invoices shall be prepared by Data User in a manner that shall provide Data Rights Owner with sufficiently detailed information to enable Data Rights Owner to trace the status of all payments under section 8, and to identify the types of data sources and data leverage opportunities that create the greatest value for Data Rights Owner and Data User, and shall present at least as much information as set forth in the sample Invoice and Data Leverage Report set forth at Schedule 8.11 

9.   Data User Resources

The Parties recognize that trustworthy Data User systems depend on reliable technology and predictable performance of people involved at all levels of providing the service.  This section details the Parties’ expectations regarding such technology and human components of the Services.

9.1 Personnel Requirements 

Data User shall make available such personnel as are necessary to properly perform Data User's obligations under this Agreement at performance levels that are at or exceed those set forth in this Agreement, the schedules, the ESLs and any CESLs, if any. 

9.2   Minimum Proficiency Levels

Data User's personnel, if any, assigned by Data User to perform Data User's obligations under this Agreement shall have the training, experience, and expertise at least equal to the greater of (i) the highest commercial standards then currently applicable to such personnel for their responsibilities in the types of Service businesses in which Data User is engaged or (ii) the standards set forth at Schedule 9.2.   [All such personnel shall also be required to be Registered Parties in their respective individual capacities before they can handle Vault Data and Circulating Data under this Agreement.]   In addition, the Services overall shall conform to the highest commercial standards applicable to such Services in the business in which Data User is engaged.

9.3   Unsatisfactory Performance

If Data Rights Owner believes that the performance or conduct of any person employed or retained by Data User to perform Data User's obligations under this Agreement is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or is otherwise unsatisfactory, Data Rights Owner shall so notify Data User through the mechanisms for such reporting provided on the Data User online interface from time to time, and Data User shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly address the performance or conduct of such person.

 	9.4.   Data Rights Owner's Policies 

[To come]

	9.5.  Confidentiality and Assignment of Meta-Data Rights

Prior to performing any services pursuant to this Agreement, all Data User Personnel shall execute the "Data User Employee Confidentiality Acknowledgment" attached hereto as Schedule 9.5 with respect to the protection of Vault Data and other confidential information and assignment of intellectual property rights in meta data generated by Data User that qualifies as Vault Data.  

It shall also be a pre-condition for an employee of Data User to be assigned to the Data User’s provision of Services that each such Data User employee shall have first become a party to this Agreement.  The purpose of this requirement is to establish that if and to the extent that a Data User employee comes into possession of Vault Data, they will be bound to those duties set forth in this Agreement both as an employee of the Data User, and in their respective personal, individual capacities. 

 	9.6.  Anti-Intrusion Policy

When accessing data, computer files, hardware, cloud-based virtual or physical systems and any other systems and facilities over which the Data Rights Owner exercises dominion and control (whether exclusive or shared with one or more third parties), Data User shall, and shall cause all Data User Personnel to, abide by all Data Rights Owner policies of which it has notice and to which it has agreed to conform, that may be established by Data Rights Owner from time to time. 

9.7. Regulatory Compliance

Data User shall reasonably assist Data Rights Owner in achieving satisfactory levels of regulatory compliance to which Data Rights Owner is subject upon Data Rights Owner’s request and cost, and further assist Data Rights Owner (also at Data Rights Owner’s request and cost) to the extent Data User's actions taken under this Agreement are attributed to Data Rights Owner. Data Rights Owner agrees to reimburse Data User for all expenses reasonably incurred and approved in advance by Data Rights Owner in complying with this Section 9.7. 

9.8. Operational Change Procedure

Data User may make operational changes in the manner in which it provides the Services, 
provided that such processes are consistent with this Agreement and the relevant Schedules as modified based on this Agreement’s change processes from time to time. 

10.  Proprietary Rights; Ownership of Vault Meta-Data as Analogous to Copyright Work Product 

Data Rights Owner shall be the owner of all of the rights in Vault Meta Data that are equivalent to those recognized under this Agreement with respect to Vault Data generally, and which Vault Meta Data rights shall be treated (solely for purposes of describing their assignment in this section 10) in a manner like traditional, assignable  copyright work product, and of all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in the Vault Meta Data, if any.  Data Rights Owner shall own all such Vault Meta Data rights equivalent to ownership in the Meta Data starting from the earlier of the date of collection or creation of such Vault Meta Data by or on behalf of the Data User.  

Each copyrightable element of the Vault Meta Data, if any, will be treated (solely for purposes of this section 10) in a manner similar to its being made as a "work made for hire" within the meaning of [insert copyright convention reference?][the Copyright Act of 1976 or equivalent copyright authority in a given jurisdiction].  In addition, to the extent that the Vault Meta Data is not a "work made for hire" within the meaning of [insert copyright convention reference?][the Copyright Act of 1976 or equivalent copyright authority in a given jurisdiction], Data User hereby assigns all right, title, and interest in and to the Vault Meta Data, and all physical or other copies thereof, and including, but not limited to, the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and all other proprietary rights in the Vault Meta Data exclusively to the Data Rights Owner, without any requirement for payment by Data Rights Owner to Data User, or any other retention of rights by Data User.   Data User shall obtain agreement from any employees, independent contractors, or subcontractors of Data User that will perform any services relating to this Agreement, of similar obligations to those described above so as to ensure Data Rights Owner's acquisition of rights equivalent to ownership of the Vault Meta Data.  

Data User agrees and acknowledges that Data Rights Owner does not intend Data User to be a “joint author” of the Vault Meta Data within the meaning of [insert copyright convention reference?][the Copyright Act of 1976 or equivalent copyright authority in a given jurisdiction].  

Data Rights Owner hereby grants to Data User a worldwide, non-transferable, non-exclusive personal license to use any Vault Meta Data solely to provide Services to Data Rights Owner and to produce Circulating Data pursuant to the terms and subject to the limitations of this Agreement, provided that any such Circulating Data produced from Vault Meta Data shall be treated as Circulating Data hereunder, as if it was produced from Vault Data.  If and to the extent that Data Rights Owner agrees to the terms and conditions of the license agreement attached hereto as Exhibit____, Data User may use the Vault Meta Data in connection with the provision of Services to one or more of Data User's other customers. 

The prior sentence shall not in any way restrict the rights of Data User to use Circulating Data that is created or generated from and with respect to any Vault Meta Data in the manner and to the extent contemplated by this Agreement, and Data User shall have all rights to use, distribute, copy, make derivative works of, perform, transfer and otherwise exploit  Circulating Data that is derived from Vault Meta Data in a manner that is equivalent to that available to it with respect to Circulating Data that is derived from Vault Data.  

Data User shall promptly and fully disclose and make available the Vault Meta Data to Data Rights Owner, and Data User shall execute and deliver any and all applications, assignments, and other documents that Data Rights Owner requests, at Data Rights Owner’s expense, for protecting its rights in the Vault Meta Data worldwide. To the extent that such actions are required to confirm or perfect the rights of Data Rights Owner, Data Rights Owner shall have the full and sole power to prosecute such applications, and Data User shall cooperate fully, at the request and expense of Data Rights Owner, in the preparation and prosecution of all such applications and in any legal actions and proceedings concerning the Vault Meta Data.  

Data User shall retain all right, title, and interest in all ideas, residuals, know-how, data, information, and techniques developed by Data User that are not Vault Meta Data, provided that Data User hereby grants to Data Rights Owner a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use any such ideas, know-how, and techniques that are embedded in or otherwise inseparable from the Vault Meta Data.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Data User shall not be obligated to erase any Circulating Data or transfer any Circulating Data to Data Rights Owner, even if such Circulating Data was derived from Vault Data originally contributed by such terminating Data Rights Owner.  From and after such termination, and the corresponding return of Vault Data to the Data Rights Owner, Data User shall not create any additional Circulating Data from the Vault Data of such Terminating Data Rights Owner, if any, that remains in its possession or control, but may continue to use any Circulating Data derived prior to such date, and may generate Circulating Data from other Circulating Data so produced without limitation hereunder.  

10.1.  Third Party Rights

 It shall be the responsibility of Data User to obtain all rights and licenses from third parties that are required for it to perform the Services. Data User grants to Data Rights Owner, and will cause to be granted, without cost to Data Rights Owner, such rights, permissions, licenses and sublicenses as may be necessary in order for Data Rights Owner to use the Services.

In addition, following a Vault Data Portability Event [and Vault Data Release], Data User shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, to Data Rights Owner, such rights, licenses (including third party licenses, if sub licensable), and permissions as are necessary for Data Rights Owner to enjoy the use of the Services provided by another Data User.  

There are no third party beneficiary rights granted under this Agreement.  To enjoy the rights and be subject to the obligations hereunder, a Data User or Data Rights Owner must be a Registered Party.

The Data Rights Owner has the right to terminate this Agreement if a Force Majeure Event prevents Data Rights Owner’s use and enjoyment of the Service or causes a material reduction in the quality of Service.  No fees shall be imposed by Data User on Data Rights Owner for Services rendered to Data User Owner after the date of receipt of notification of termination from a Data Rights Owner.

11.6.  Effect of Termination 

This Agreement binds Registered Parties into a community as both Data Rights Owners and Data Users.  As in any community, relationships vary among community members, and are occasionally terminated between particular members.  Under this Agreement, Registered Parties can choose the parties with which they choose to interact pursuant to the Agreement terms.  When those relationships don’t work out, a Registered Party can choose to terminate their relationship with a particular Registered Party under this Agreement, while still maintaining such relationships with other Registered Parties.  

A Registered Party may choose to terminate their relationship with another particular Registered Party in its capacity as either a Data Rights Owner or a Data User.   With respect to a particular terminating Registered Party, this Agreement will remain in effect, notwithstanding the occurrence of a Termination Event, with respect to any other Registered Party, until all duties and obligations of such Parties associated with Termination have been performed, discharged, or excused.  

In the event of a termination of this Agreement for any reason set forth in this section 11 or the expiration of the term of this Agreement, all Vault Data and Vault Meta Data shall be handled in the manner provided in section 12, and all payments shall be finalized pursuant to section __.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Registered Party acting as a Data User shall be under no obligation to treat Circulating Data in the manner provided in section 12, and all right title and interest in and to such Circulating Data shall remain with the Data User notwithstanding the occurrence of a Termination Event or Expiration of this Agreement.

12. Vault Data Portability Event and Vault Data Release

Acknowledgement of Rights: To the extent that a Registered Party holds or has control of data that is Vault Data (including but not limited to Vault Meta-Data), the parties acknowledge and agree that all such Vault Data is held, maintained, managed, applied, transferred and otherwise used by Data User on a co-managed basis, on behalf of and for the benefit of Data Rights Owner.  

By contrast, to the extent that Data User holds or controls Circulating Data, the parties acknowledge and agree that all such Circulating Data is held by Data User on its own behalf, and that Data Rights Owner has no right, title or interest in or to such Circulating Data (subject to the responsibility of Data User to pay amounts to Data Rights Owner for its use of Circulating Data that was generated with Vault Data, calculated as set forth in section ___ of this Agreement), unless and until such Circulating data is subjected to “re-identification” processes, once again becoming Vault Data .

 	12.1.  Vault Data Portability Event 

Upon the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the Term with respect to a Registered Party, (ii) a Registered Party providing a Notice of Termination in its capacity as a Data Rights Owner to another Registered Party in its capacity as a Data User, (iii) a Registered Party providing a Notice of Termination in its capacity as a Data User to another Registered Party in its capacity as a Data Rights Owner, or (iv) a Termination of this Agreement under section 11 , the Registered Parties to which actions (i)-(iv) apply, including the Registered Party that holds Vault Data and Vault Meta Data (a “Portability-Responsible Registered Party”), will take the following actions to carry into effect Data Rights Owner’s right to Vault Data and Vault Meta Data portability (collectively, "Vault Data Portability Actions”).

 	12.1(a) The Parties shall cooperate with one another to minimize the interruption of Services associated with the transition from the Portability-Responsible Registered Party as a Data User to one or more alternative Registered Parties as Data Users as selected by Data Rights Owner ;

12.1(b) Portability-Responsible Registered Party shall continue to provide the Services over the period of time during which the Vault Data Portability Actions are being taken, and its obligation to provide the Services will end upon the completion of such actions.   Data Rights Owner shall be responsible to pay the pro-rated amount of any usual charges for the Services during such period, if any, adjusted to reflect the period of time during which the Data Portability Actions are being taken, and offset by any prorated payments due to Data Rights Owner under other sections of this Agreement;

12.1(c) In addition to the transfer of Vault Data and Vault Meta-Data by Portability-Responsible Registered Party pursuant to the Vault Data Portability Actions, Portability-Responsible Registered Party shall also make available (or cause to be made available) to Data Rights Owner (and to such replacement provider of Services relating to such Vault Data), such rights in any technology (including software, “cloud-based” and other third party services, and other services and rights) as are necessary for Data Rights Owner to continue to enjoy the use of Vault Data and Meta Vault Data, without infringing any rights of Portability-Responsible Registered Party, in a manner that is reasonably consistent with the use of such data that was made available to it through the Services, provided that Portability-Responsible Registered Party may charge a reasonable and non-discriminatory charge for any such “transition rights” if and to the extent that such rights are separately invoiced or charged for to other customers. ; and

 	12.1(d)  Following the completion of the Vault Data Portability Actions, Portability-Responsible Registered Party shall delete all Vault Data and Vault Meta Data and destroy (or have destroyed) all copies thereof, and shall disable and render ineffective any other means of providing permissioned access to such Vault Data that are held by Portability-Responsible Registered Party or its third party subcontractors, if any.  

Portability-Responsible Registered Party shall not be responsible for the deletion or destruction of or disablement of access to any Vault Data or Vault Meta Data that it transferred or made available to any third parties at the request of and on behalf of Data Rights Owner, and Data Rights Owner acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for understanding any such third party terms and portability processes and engaging in the actions needed to effect a return or removal of such permissioned access of such data held by third parties, and will not require Data User to engage in such destruction, return, or removal actions with respect to such data on its behalf; provided, however, that the Data User may agree, in its sole discretion, to provide assistance to Data Rights Owner with respect to any such recovery of third party data.  

13.  DEFAULT; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 13.1.  Remedies 

13.1(a) Data Rights Owner's Remedies

Upon the occurrence of a Material Default under this Agreement that remains uncured by a Registered Party, acting in its capacity as a Data User, Data Rights Owner shall be entitled to Terminate this Agreement under section 11 with respect to such defaulting Registered Party [in their capacity as Data User].  Data Rights Owner’s termination of this Agreement shall not constitute its sole and exclusive remedy for such default, nor a waiver by Data Rights Owner of its rights to bring such other actions, in law or equity, as may be available to it with respect to the default. 

13.1(b) Data User's Remedies

If a Registered Party acting as a Data Rights Owner commits a Material Default under this Agreement that remains uncured, including but not limited to a Data Right’s Owner’s default under Section 8 (fee payment), Data User will be entitled to Terminate this Agreement under section 11 with respect to such defaulting Registered Party [in their capacity as Data Rights Owner].  Data User’s termination of this Agreement shall not constitute its sole and exclusive remedy for such default, nor a waiver by Data User of its rights to bring such other actions, in law or equity, as may be available to it with respect to the default.  In no event will Data User’s remedies in the event of a default include the right to restrict access by a Data Rights Owner of Vault Data or Vault Meta Data  

13.2  Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY REGISTERED PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST INCOME OR LOST REVENUE. 

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BELOW, EACH REGISTERED PARTY'S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY HEREUNDER FOR ALL DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FORM  OF SUCH ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE), SHALL BE LIMITED TO DATA USER'S NET REVENUE GENERATED BY DATA USER WITH RESPECT TO DATA (INCLUDING VAULT DATA, VAULT META DATA AND CIRCULATING DATA) THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH DATA MADE AVAILABLE TO DATA USER AS A RESULT OF THE MAINTENANCE OF DATA RIGHTS OWNER’S ACCOUNT.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATION ON DATA USER’S LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS FOR WHICH DATA USER OWES A PAYMENT TO DATA RIGHTS OWNER FOR BREACH OF A PARTICULAR ELS or CELS, CLAIMS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY DATA USER UNDER SECTION 20, OR CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OF VAULT DATA UNDER SECTION 17.8.

13.3.  Force Majeure Events

Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, a Registered Party may provide notice to the other Registered Party that its performance under this Agreement has been negatively impacted by such Force Majeure Event, following which notice, the obligation of the affected Registered Party providing such notice to engage in such performance shall be suspended during the period prior to the time that the affected Registered Party can reasonably once again engage in such performance following the ending of such Force Majeure Event.  Following the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, both Parties shall apply reasonable, good faith efforts to minimize delays in their respective performance under this Agreement.

14.  INSURANCE

 	14.1.  Scheduled Requirements

Institutional Registered Parties functioning as Data Users shall purchase and maintain insurance to protect Data User from all claims of the type set forth in Schedule 14 (Insurance) that arise out of, relate to, or result from Data User’s operation, administration or performance of the Services under this Agreement and for which Data User may be liable.   

14.2.  General Requirements

Data User shall purchase and maintain insurance to protect Data User from all claims of the type set forth in Schedule 14 that arise with respect to its (and its agents, subcontractors and independent contractors that contribute to Data User’s performance hereunder) provision of Services and performance under this Agreement.  Such insurance shall at all times be maintained at least at a level that is the greater of the limits of coverage specified in Schedule 14 or that required under applicable local law to the Services provided to Data Rights Owner.  Data User’s purchase of the insurance required in Schedule 14 shall not relieve it of its other obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to its obligations to [to come].  

 	15.  REPORTS TO DATA RIGHTS OWNER

Registered Parties acting as Data Users shall provide online access to Data Rights Owners to up-to-date reports in the form, with the contents, and of the scope set forth in Schedule 15 hereto.  Data User acknowledges that conformity of its reports with the requirements of Schedule 15 is an important element of Data Portability and Data Rights Owner education, since it enables Data Rights Owners to compare Data User’s Services to other similar services offered by other Registered Parties, and agrees to apply its commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to prepare and present such reports in a form and manner that maximizes Data Rights Owner understanding of and efficacy and proficiency with respect to using the Services and the enjoyment of benefits and minimization of burdens that they can help produce for Data Rights Owners. 

16.  RECORDKEEPING AND AUDIT RIGHTS

“CESLS” shall mean [to come].


 “Circulating Data” shall mean all data collected, created, held, transferred, or otherwise used by a Data User in a configuration, association, correlation, cross reference, or other inter-datum or inter-file relationship such that it [is not Vault Data][does not, without more, inform an inference about the identity of either a human or legal Entity in the context in which it is being used [or made available to the immediate transferee.  Circulating Data can become Vault Data with a change in the context of the transferee (user/observer), e.g., a seemingly random string of nine numbers (Circulating Data) in one jurisdiction can be recognized as a social security number (Vault Data) in the U.S. 


 “Circulating Data End User” shall mean any third party that receives Circulating Data from Data User. 


 “Confidential Information" shall mean with respect to a given Data Rights Owner Participant, the Vault Data (including Vault Meta Data) of, relating to, or relatable to such Participant.  Confidential Information shall not include Circulating Data.  Circulating Data and other Re-Identified Data is considered to be Vault Data upon its re-identification, and so is also qualified as “Confidential Information” upon such re-identification.  Confidential Information shall not include Regulated Vault Data or Regulated Vault Meta Data.



D

“Data Action Event” shall mean [to come].


“Data Actions” shall mean those actions taken with respect to data by a Registered Party acting in its capacity as a Data User, and shall include, but not be limited to data collection, use, transfer, combination with other data, analysis, holding, disposal [insert other actions].


 “Data User Collection Services” shall mean those elements of the Data Users Trust Framework conformant System applied by Data User to support Data Rights Owner's data management services needs with respect to the acquisition of data for protection and use as Vault Data, Shared Vault Data and de-identification preceding its use as Circulating Data.


“Data User Intermediaries” shall mean [to come].


"Data Integrity" shall mean, with respect to a given standard, the objectively measurable reliability, consistency and accuracy of collected data as determined in accordance with the criteria and methods described in Schedule 3.7.


“Data Rights Owner” means a Registered Party acting in the role of a Service recipient who has the right to determine whether and to what extent it will share Vault Data[ including Vault Data intended for transmission to, storage in, quantification by and sharing through the Reality System]. Through use of the Services, the Data Rights Owner can effect or limit the transmission of or permit or restrict access to Vault Data[, including behavioral, location and other data to third parties and to the Reality System through web-based systems and mobile devices that have been linked to that Data Rights Owner during their Enrollment and Registration, or subsequently]. The Data Rights Owner owns and controls the rights associated with the use and sharing of Vault Data held by the Data User[ and in the Reality System].


"Data Rights Owner's Vault Data" shall mean that subset of Vault Data that was transferred by [or on behalf of] the Data Rights Owner to the Data User.  The term “Vault Data” includes “Vault Meta Data,” except for purposes of this definition (since the Data Rights Owner does not transfer Vault Meta Data to the Data User.  Thus, Data Rights Owner’s Vault Data does not include “Vault Meta Data,” that was, for example, generated by the Data User and other system meta data that is not Vault Meta Data, i.e., data relating to such Party's behavior, Data User interaction and transaction history, Data User usage practices, historical transferees of Shared Vault Data and Circulating Data), or received by the Data User from a third party for use by Data User in connection with the provision of the Services to such Data Rights Owner.  Upon a Data Portability Event, Data Rights Owner receives all copies of such Data Rights Owner’s Vault Data, but only receives a copy of the Vault Meta Data. 


 “De-Identified Data” shall mean those sets of data that when revised, modified, combined with other data, or otherwise altered, are no longer Personally Identifying Information under relevant law or rules applicable to a given context  


“Data User” means the Registered Party that has access to, possession or, or control over any Vault Data or Circulating Data.   



E

Enrollment 


Entity  


"Effective Date" shall mean, as to any particular Data Rights Owner, the later of (i) the date on which they agreed to these terms as part of the Data User Registration Process, or (ii) the date of the completion of their Enrollment by Data User.

"Fee Reduction" shall mean the amount determined pursuant to Section 8.9 hereof that represents a reduction in the price of Data User Services charged to a Data Rights Owner as the result of a Data User system deficiency that impacts performance under an ESL set forth in section 4.  The price of Data User Services is potentially offset by both Fee Reductions (offsets for ESL deficiencies) and Fee Offsets (netting).  


“Fee Offset” shall mean the amount determined pursuant to Section __ hereof by which the charges that would otherwise be invoiced by Data User to Data Rights Owner for the provision of Vault Data Storage Services are offset by payments to be made by Data User to Data Rights Owner.  Fee Offsets are calculated as the sum of (i) payments actually received from third parties for the use of Shared Vault Data of the Data Rights Owner (less any Data User service fee/commission) plus (ii) the percentage of revenue payable to Data Rights Owner for Data User’s sharing of Circulating Data derived from the Vault Data of such Data Rights Owner.  While both Fee Reductions and Fee Offsets reduce the amount owed by Data Rights Owners, they differ in that, while eligibility for Fee Reductions is determined with respect to ESL performance, Fee Offsets are not applied to account for such ESL deficiencies but instead as an incentive to drive innovative use of data consistent with Data Rights Owner’s interests.

SCHEDULE 3.4

Vault Data Sharing Services (including various identity management and attribute-related services, credentialing services, etc. (see Section 3.4 and Schedule 3.4)


[To Come – See notes accompanying Section 3.4.]

[Requirements include: 

Any transfer or use of any Vault Data as Vault Data by Data User (other than the creation of Circulating Data) is subject to Data Rights Owner notice and consent.

As long as agreement is fair and accurate, Data Rights Owner notice and consent process associated with this Service can be structured to be for single transactions, multiple transactions, all transactions relating to a particular relationship or area or other structures that allow Data Rights Owner to “trust” Data User to act as its “publicity agent” on its behalf with respect to use of Vault Data.

Commission is earned by Data User from revenues associated with permissioned Vault Data use.

Other than commission earned by Data User (which is anticipated to be funded by third party payments for access/use of Vault Data), the Data User makes no charge for this Service to Data Rights Owner.]





 

SCHEDULE 3.5

Circulating Data Leverage Services (see Section 3.5 and Schedule 3.5)


[To Come – See notes accompanying Section 3.5.]

[Requirements include: 

NOTE:  Unlike Vault Data related Services, this “Service” activity is engaged in by Data User on its own behalf – like a bank engaged in lending money based on fractional reserve lending based on its “vault cash” calculated with reference to its receipts from depository accounts.] 

Data User is required to “de-identify” Data to a certain level of safety (entropy) based on objectively testable processes and protocols turning Vault Data into Circulating Data.  The establishment of objectively testable criteria for de-identification enables audit, etc. and provides sufficient process certainty to justify the provision of contractual “safe harbor” protection for Data Users that abide by and conform to such processes and protocols.

Data User can share Circulating Data (but not Vault Data) with third parties without Data Rights Owner’s permission.  

Data User generates revenues from use of Circulating Data.  Circulating Data feeds “big data” applications to generate value.

A portion of the revenue from Circulating Data is used to offset the Data Rights Owner charges, if any, (for example in the case of commercial, institutional Data Users, for Warehousing and Protection services for Vault Data.

A small portion of Circulating Data revenues is paid into a pool among Data Users that funds their creation of a collective “reserve” account to pay “liquidated damages” to Data Rights Owners that experience specific, scheduled system harms as a result of the failure of a Data User to achieve an ESL (or other contractual setting) for which specific compensation amounts (in the nature of contractual liquidated damages have been established.  

Use of a collective reserve among Data Users creates B2B “peer pressure” for individual Data Users to conform to Data User performance standards, since every time the collective reserve is tapped into to pay claims, all Data Users need to pay more into the reserve.  This will cause the Data Users that are performing consistent with the Agreement to subsidize the poor performers, which will, in turn, motivate the better performing Data Users to self-police the community of Data User.  This is a similar approach taken in the context of various global fisheries, where self-policing structures also rely on the compulsion of economics of diminishments of “pooled by-catch quotas,” rather than on the compulsion of sovereign laws.  It is arguable that where the structure is intended to bridge multiple jurisdictions, a form of economic compulsion is more scalable.

It is possible that commercial, institutional Data Users will generate revenue to result in net income sufficient so that they can make a profit and share any excess with Data Rights Owners.  This is a potential competitive differentiator among Data Users that are willing to embrace the needs of Data Rights Owners to improve their online “identity integrity.”  Data Rights Owners will likely prefer to interact (commercially, socially, etc.) with Data Users that offer a combination of more security, privacy and a greater “return” on data leverage to Data Rights Owners.  Even socially, people tend to prefer relationships with people who they can “trust” to be discreet with the information that they share.  And who respect the boundaries of acceptable use of data.  (See, for example, Helen Nissenbaum’s concepts of “contextual integrity” and “distribution norms” here).  This package of Services will potentially attract more Data Rights Owners to that Data User, yielding more Vault Data, which in turn has can generate more Circulating Data, which in turn generates more data leverage.

Data Users that perform “de-identification” of Vault Data (to derive Circulating Data) in conformity to objectively testable, agreed upon standards will be given “safe harbor” treatment (by operation of the agreement, not statute or regulation) against a class of legal claims identified in the Agreement.  This contractual “safe harbor” is a benefit that provides some of the cost certainty needed to make data leverage service provision attractive to potential Data User candidates.  The “safe harbor” is part of the package of contract “consideration” provided to help incentivize system-supporting behavior that conforms to Data User duties under the Agreement.]

SCHEDULE 21

Dispute Resolution

[To Come]

[Note that Dispute resolution is intended to be automated in order to enable scaled solutions for large volumes of small transactions and interactions that will take place with respect to both Vault Data and Circulating Data.

Also, we are currently engaging in research into alternative forms of alternative dispute resolution.  Specifically, it is recognized that only a subset of Internet users will ever encounter “western style” dispute resolution processes, and that as smart phone and other hardware interfaces to hyper-connected data networks become more ubiquitous (for example through the billions of deployed smartphones worldwide), the proportion of Data Rights Owners using the systems that are familiar with more traditional (“non-western”) forms of dispute resolution will increase.  

Specifically, we are exploring the shared characteristics of more “indigenous” forms of dispute resolution for candidate structures that can be deployed to expedite dispute resolution for massively distributed legal structures such as that contemplated by this Agreement.  

To date, several characteristics have been identified that are informing dispute resolution structures for this Agreement.  This includes (i) the emphasis on “compensatory” rather than “punitive” measures of damages calculations as remedies (manifested in the ESL and “liquidated damages” elements of the Agreement), (ii) enablement of opportunity for an aggrieved party to “tell their story” (use of transparent accounting and “peer reputation system) and (iii) use of elders and experts to deliberate on matters (self-regulatory processes for disputes that are not within ESL’s, and are characteristic of a particular sub-community of Registered Parties (such as within an industry, within a country, etc.).

For example, item (i), the reliance on compensatory structures, helped to inform the mechanism for creating a “reserve” to fund “liquidated damages” for violations of objectively testable ESLs (expected service levels) is one facet of the proposed automation.  The basis for this approach also reflects the fact that it is likely that system disputes will cluster around certain themes that will occur repeatedly.  That repetition will generate history of the cost of response and compensation that will enable the accurate prediction of an amount that would constitute a fair settlement for such a common system problem.  As that claims experience accumulates, and minor system problems become automatically compensated through a sort of “no fault” system covering minor and common problems, those aspects of dispute resolution start to become “product features” since they are easier to use than services where minor problems must be handled piecemeal.

For those disputes that are outside of the ESL/liquidated damages structure, a modified form of “escalation” procedure should be considered that can accommodate various forms of mediation, arbitration and, in extreme cases, litigation in an integrated fashion, while still accommodating local jurisdictional (i.e., legal) or sectorial (i.e., industry practice) processes at each stage.
